# Documentation Update Summary - October 15, 2025

## üéØ What Was Done

Successfully updated and organized all deployment documentation to reflect the new **entrypoint pattern architecture** (v4.0) and deprecated outdated documentation describing the old external migration pattern (v3.0 and earlier).

---

## ‚úÖ Files Updated

### **1. Created New Documentation Status Index**

**New File:** [DEPLOYMENT-DOCS-STATUS.md](./DEPLOYMENT-DOCS-STATUS.md)
- Complete index of all deployment documentation
- Clear categorization: Current vs. Deprecated vs. Archived
- Navigation guide for different use cases
- Migration guide from old to new patterns

### **2. Updated Core Reference Files**

#### [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Added reference to entrypoint pattern architecture
- Updated deployment workflow section to describe new pattern
- Added links to new deployment documentation
- Marked old files as deprecated (scripts/deploy.sh, DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md)
- Added "Deployment Documentation" section with complete navigation

**Key Addition:**
```markdown
**Architecture Pattern - Entrypoint (Industry Standard):**
- Migrations run **inside containers** on startup (not externally)
- Self-contained: Each container handles its own initialization
- Self-healing: Failed migrations = failed container = automatic rollback
- Health checks validate: Migrations + App + Endpoint (atomic validation)
```

#### [docs/current/PRD_v8.0.md](./docs/current/PRD_v8.0.md) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Updated CI/CD Infrastructure section (4.3)
- Added architecture version (v4.0) and entrypoint pattern reference
- Added links to new deployment documentation
- Updated deployment workflow steps to describe entrypoint pattern
- Updated metrics to include 75% code reduction

### **3. Deprecated Old Documentation**

#### [docs/architecture/DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md](./docs/architecture/DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md) ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED
**Added prominent deprecation notice:**
- Explains why it's deprecated (external migration pattern with 200+ lines, 7 failure points)
- Links to current documentation
- Kept for historical reference

#### [docs/architecture/BUILD-PROCESS.md](./docs/architecture/BUILD-PROCESS.md) üìå UPDATED
**Added informational notice:**
- Document remains mostly accurate
- Note about ENTRYPOINT addition for migrations
- Links to new documentation for complete context

#### [docs/current/Deployment_Architecture_v3.md](./docs/current/Deployment_Architecture_v3.md) ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED
**Added deprecation notice:**
- Marked as superseded by v4.0
- Explains what changed
- Links to current documentation
