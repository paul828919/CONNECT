## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Work Rules - Read First
### 1. Local verification is mandatory
**Do not commit or push without local verification.**
- **Rule**: When executing a task, always verify it locally after completion. Commit and push only after local verification is complete.
- **Time**: Production deployment takes approximately 12 minutes. Local verification takes 2-5 minutes. Always verify first.
**Never use browser automation tools (Playwright) when inspecting GitHub Actions pages.**
- **Rule**: I(user) will personally visit the pagehttps://github.com/paul828919/CONNECT/actionsÎ•º to check and share the latest run results. 
- **Docker Requirement**: If Docker is not running locally during development or modification, **notify the user to start Docker**. Never skip local verification solely because Docker is not running.
- **No Exceptions**: Even ‚Äúsimple‚Äù changes like configuration files, YAML syntax, or document updates are no exception.
**Importance:**
- Prevents production failures taking over 12 minutes to discover
- Detects issues locally within 2-5 minutes that would take hours to debug in production
- Industry Standard: Local ‚Üí CI ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production (Never skip the local stage)
### 2. Security: SSH Keys Only
**Never use passwords in commands.**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct method - Always use SSH key authentication
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_connect user@221.164.102.253
# ‚ùå Incorrect Method - Never use password authentication
sshpass -p ‚Äòpassword‚Äô ssh user@221.164.102.253
```
### 3. üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Architecture (Production-Grade Entrypoint Pattern)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production-ready (100% successful deployments since October 15, 2025)
**Architecture Pattern:** Industry-standard entrypoint
**Changes (October 15, 2025):**
- ‚ùå **Previous Approach (5 Failures)**: External migration orchestration - 200 lines, 7 failure points
- ‚úÖ **New Approach (100% Success)**: Entrypoint pattern (Heroku/AWS/K8s model) - 50 lines, self-healing
**How It Works:**
```
Push to GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions trigger Docker build ‚Üí SSH connection to server ‚Üí
Zero-downtime rolling update ‚Üí Execute migration at container startup (entrypoint) ‚Üí
Health check verification ‚Üí Success (or automatic rollback)
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important - Must verify before Docker build:**
**Development Environment:** MacBook Pro M4 Max (ARM64/aarch64 architecture)
**Production Environment:** Linux server 221.164.102.253 (x86_64/amd64 architecture)
**Essential Build Command (used in all sessions):**
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.production -t connect:latest .
```
**Criticality:**
1. **Architecture Mismatch** - ARM-built containers from Mac crash on x86 Linux production due to missing system libraries
2. **Silent Errors** - Docker shows no errors during build, but containers fail at runtime with cryptic errors like:
- `exec /usr/local/bin/node: exec format error` (Incorrect CPU architecture)
- `npm ERR! missing: @prisma/client` (Native binding compiled for ARM instead of x86)

- `libssl.so.3: cannot open shared object file` (incorrect system library version)
3. **Production Impact** - Recent case: October 17, 2025 - 502 downtime due to npm EACCES error
**Alternative: Set Default Platform (Optional but Recommended)**
Add the following to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
```
Restart your terminal. All subsequent `docker build` commands will use x86_64 as the default.
**Post-build verification:**
```bash
# Verify image architecture (Must display ‚Äúlinux/amd64‚Äù)
docker inspect connect:latest --format=‚Äò{ {.Architecture}}‚Äô
```

**Core Files:**
1. `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Runs internal migration upon container startup (20 lines)
2. `Dockerfile.production` - Multi-stage build including entrypoint
3. `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Automated deployment (50 lines)
4. `docker-compose.production.yml` - Orchestration including 90-second health checks
**Key Concepts:**
- **Migrations run inside containers** (not externally via `docker run`)
- **Self-contained**: Each container handles its own initialization
- **Self-healing**: Migration failure = container failure = automatic rollback
- **Atomic verification**: Health checks simultaneously validate migration + application + endpoint

## Project Overview
Connect is **Korea's R&D Commercialization Operating System**, transforming companies' research funding acquisition journey from discovery to contract award. This platform combines automated matching with specialized execution services, positioning companies as primary paying customers (research institutions serve as supply-side partners for consortium matching).
**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Beyond simple research funding discovery** - Full commercialization support (discovery ‚Üí application ‚Üí award)
- **Hybrid business model** - Software (‚Ç©490,000‚Äì990,000/month) + Services (‚Ç©2‚Äì7 million/project)
- **Enterprise-centric** - 90% of revenue comes from enterprises; research institutes are free supply-side partners
- **Exclusive data competitiveness** - Performance tracking (win rate, cycle time) creates competitive advantage
- **Generates revenue from month 1** - Immediate cash flow secured through service provision


### Deployment Documentation
