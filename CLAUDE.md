## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORK RULES - READ FIRST

### 1. Local Verification is MANDATORY

**NEVER commit and push without local verification.**

- **Rule**: When executing any task, ALWAYS verify the work locally upon completion. Only after local verification is complete should you commit and push.
- **Timing**: Deployment to production takes ~12 minutes. Local verification takes 2-5 minutes. Always verify first.
- **Docker requirement**: If Docker is not running locally during development or modification, **tell the user to start Docker**. Never skip local verification just because Docker isn't running.
- **No exceptions**: Even for "simple" changes like config files, YAML syntax, or documentation updates.

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents production failures that take 12+ minutes to discover
- Catches issues in 2-5 minutes locally vs. hours of production debugging
- Industry standard: Local → CI → Staging → Production (NEVER skip local)

### 2. Security: SSH Keys Only

**NEVER use passwords in commands.**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Always use SSH key authentication
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_connect user@221.164.102.253

# ❌ WRONG - Never use password authentication
sshpass -p 'password' ssh user@221.164.102.253
```

### 3. 🏗️ CI/CD Architecture (Production-grade entrypoint pattern)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready (100% successful deployments since October 15, 2025)
**Architecture pattern:** Industry-standard entrypoint

**Changes (October 15, 2025):**
- ❌ **Old Method (5 failures)**: External migration orchestration - 200 lines, 7 failure points
- ✅ **New Method (100% success)**: Entrypoint pattern (Heroku/AWS/K8s model) - 50 lines, self-healing

**How it works:**
```
Push to GitHub → GitHub Actions trigger Docker build → SSH connection to server →
Zero-downtime rolling update → Migration runs at container startup (entrypoint) →
Health check validation → Success (or auto-rollback)
```

**Core Files:**
1. `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Runs internal migration at container startup (20 lines)
2. `Dockerfile.production` - Multi-stage build including entrypoint
3. `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Automated deployment (50 lines)
4. `docker-compose.production.yml` - Orchestration including 90-second health checks

**Core Concepts:**
- **Migration runs inside the container** (not externally via `docker run`)
- **Self-containment**: Each container handles its own initialization
- **Self-healing**: Migration failure = container failure = automatic rollback
- **Atomic verification**: Health checks simultaneously validate migration + application + endpoints

## Project Overview

Connect is **Korea's R&D commercialization operating system** that transforms companies' grant-seeking journey from discovery through winning. The platform combines automated matching with professional execution services, targeting companies as primary paying customers (research institutes as supply-side for consortium matching).

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Not just grant discovery** - Complete commercialization support (discovery → application → winning)
- **Hybrid business model** - Software (₩49-99K/month) + Services (₩2-7M per engagement)
- **Companies first** - 90% revenue from companies, institutes as free supply-side partners
- **Proprietary data moat** - Outcome tracking (win rates, cycle times) creates competitive advantage
- **Profitable Month 1** - Services provide immediate cash flow

**Critical Timeline:**
- MVP Development: 8 weeks (Weeks 1-2: Foundation, Weeks 3-4: Data + Outcomes, Weeks 5-6: Services, Weeks 7-8: Launch)

## Business Model & Revenue Strategy

### Hybrid Model: Software + Services

**Software (SaaS Subscription):**
- **Free**: ₩0/month - 10 matches/month, basic features (freemium funnel)
- **Pro**: ₩49,000/month - Unlimited matches, sector gates, outcome data
- **Team**: ₩99,000/month - 5 seats, consortium tools, priority support
- **Target**: 140 paying users by Month 6 → ₩6.86M MRR

**Services (High-margin Consulting):**
- **Application Review**: ₩2-3M per project (7-10 days, win rate +10-15%)
- **Certification Planning**: ₩3-5M (ISMS-P, KC certification roadmap)
- **Consortium Formation**: ₩3-5M (partner matching, warm intros)
- **TRL Advancement**: ₩5-7M (technology development consulting)
- **Target**: 10 engagements by Month 6 → ₩30-50M

**Why Hybrid Works:**
1. **Immediate Cash Flow**: Services provide ₩25M+ from Month 1 (vs. waiting for MRR)
2. **Sustainable Pricing**: ₩49-99K covers infrastructure without external funding
3. **Defensible Moat**: Competitors can't replicate services expertise
4. **Customer Success**: Services help users win → positive outcomes → better matching
5. **Profitability**: Break-even Month 1 (vs. Month 8+ with software-only)

**Revenue Projections:**
- Month 3: ₩18M/month (₩3.4M MRR + ₩15M services)
- Month 6: ₩48M/month (₩7.9M MRR + ₩40M services)
- Cumulative Month 1-6: ₩200M+

### Critical Legal Compliance: Off-Budget Services Invoicing

**MUST KNOW**: Services CANNOT be included in government R&D project budgets.

**Legal Requirement (국가연구개발사업 연구개발비 사용 기준):**
- Connect services = Business development costs (사업개발비)
- Must be invoiced separately from R&D project costs
- Must be paid from company's operating budget (운영비), NOT grant budget (연구개발비)
- Violation = Customer audit risk + Connect legal liability

**MSA Clause (in all service agreements):**
```
제4조 (서비스 비용 청구)
본 서비스는 기업의 사업개발 비용으로 청구되며, 
정부 R&D 과제 연구개발비 예산에 포함되지 않습니다.

법적 근거:
- 「국가연구개발사업 연구개발비 사용 기준」 (IITP 고시 제2025-02호)
- 연구개발비는 직접비(인건비, 연구재료비 등)와 간접비로만 구성
- 일반 컨설팅 비용은 연구개발비 항목 외
```

**Sales Process:**
1. Always explain during sales call: "이 서비스는 귀사의 운영 예산으로 결제됩니다"
2. Invoice separately from any R&D projects
3. FAQ prominently displayed: "부가 서비스 비용은 R&D 예산에 넣을 수 있나요? → 아니요"

## Data Collection Strategy

### Hybrid Approach: NTIS API + Playwright

**Primary Source: NTIS API** (Phase 1 Complete - Oct 6, 2025)
- **Coverage**: 108,798+ R&D programs (comprehensive government database)
- **Purpose**: Historical pattern analysis, win rate benchmarking, success metrics
- **Schedule**: Daily at 8:00 AM KST
- **Technology**: axios + xml2js for XML parsing
- **Status**: Production-ready, awaiting production key (Oct 14, 2025)
- **Value**: Powers insights like "귀사와 유사한 조직의 평균 선정률: 38%"

**Secondary Source: Playwright Web Scraping**
- **Coverage**: 200-500 active calls from 4 agencies (realistic current opportunities)
- **Purpose**: Real-time announcement monitoring
- **Schedule**:
  - Normal: 2x daily (9:00 AM, 3:00 PM KST)
  - Peak Season (Jan-March): 4x daily (9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM KST)
- **Technology**: Playwright + Bull queue + node-cron
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/minute per agency

**Targeted Agencies (4 covering ~55% of R&D budget):**
- **IITP** (정보통신기획평가원) - Ministry of Science and ICT (~15% of budget)
- **KEIT** (한국산업기술평가관리원) - Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (~12% of budget)
- **TIPA** (중소기업기술정보진흥원) - Ministry of SMEs and Startups (~8% of budget)
- **KIMST** (해양수산과학기술진흥원) - Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries

**Deduplication & Integration:**
- Content hashing prevents duplicates from both sources
- `scraping_source` field: 'NTIS_API' or agency id ('iitp', 'keit', etc.)
- Users benefit from: Comprehensive historical data + Real-time updates

**CRITICAL: Honest Claims (No "100K+ programs" overpromising)**
- Homepage: "국내 주요 4개 기관 최신 공고 200~500건 (매일 업데이트)"
- Subtext: "Plus: 역대 R&D 과제 108,000+ 건 성공 패턴 분석"
- Why: Honest expectations → higher retention vs. overpromising → disappointment → churn

- Score 0-100 with visual indicator
- Estimated win probability (future ML model)
- Korean explanation array
- Status: ✅ Eligible / ⚠️ Warning / 🚫 Blocked
- CTA: "신청 준비하기" (leads to services)

### 2. Procurement Readiness Calculator

**Purpose**: Help companies qualify for procurement-track funding (혁신제품, 우수제품)

**Scoring Model (0-100):**
- Product Maturity (30 points): TRL 9 = 30pts, TRL 8 = 20pts, TRL 7 = 10pts
- Certifications (30 points): KC = 15pts, ISO 9001 = 10pts, ISMS-P = 5pts
- Track Record (20 points): 3+ govt projects = 20pts, 1-2 = 10pts, 0 = 0pts
- Quality System (20 points): Warranty = 7pts, A/S = 7pts, Support = 6pts

**Gap Analysis:**
- Identifies missing requirements
- Estimates time to resolve (1-24 months)
- Estimates cost to resolve (₩1M-200M)
- Prioritizes gaps (high/medium/low)
- CTAs for services: "TRL 상향 컨설팅 (₩5-7M)", "인증 계획 (₩3-5M)"

### 3. Outcome Tracking System (Proprietary Data Moat)

**Purpose**: Create defensible competitive advantage through win rate intelligence

**Data Collection (Opt-in, PIPA-compliant):**
- Application status (applied Y/N, date)
- Result (won/lost/pending/withdrawn)
- Financial data (optional): Requested/award amounts
- Feedback: Difficulty rating (1-5), match quality (1-5)
- Explicit consent checkbox: "매칭 정확도 향상을 위해 결과 데이터를 공유합니다"

**Privacy-Preserving Aggregation:**
- Minimum 5 data points required for any stat
- Individual results NEVER disclosed
- Example outputs:
  - "귀사와 유사한 산업(ICT) × TRL(7-8) 조직의 IITP 선정률: 38%"
  - "평균 심사 기간: 87일"
  - "Most successful sectors: ICT (45%), Industrial (32%)"

**Competitive Moat:**
- Competitors only have public announcement data
- Connect has win rates, cycle times, success patterns
- Advantage compounds: More users → More data → Better predictions
- Roadmap: Basic stats (Y1) → ML models (Y2) → Prescriptive advice (Y3)

### 4. Services Management System

**Service Types:**
1. Application Review (₩2-3M, 7-10 days)
2. Certification Planning (₩3-5M, 2-3 weeks)
3. Consortium Formation (₩3-5M, 3-4 weeks)
4. TRL Advancement (₩5-7M, 4-6 weeks)

**Engagement Workflow:**
1. Lead generation (in-app CTAs, email nurture, webinar upsells)
2. Discovery call (30 min, understand need)
3. Proposal (2 days, custom quote + deliverables)
4. Contract signing (MSA with off-budget clause)
5. Kickoff (1 week after payment)
6. Delivery (1-4 weeks depending on service)
7. Follow-up (outcome tracking, testimonial request)

**Conversion Funnel:**
- 1,000 Pro users → 100 consult requests → 30 proposals → 10 closed deals
- Conversion rate: 10% (request → close)
- Target: 10 engagements/Month 6 = ₩30-50M

## Critical Development Considerations

### Hot Standby Requirements (Peak Season: Jan-March)

**Why Critical:**
- January-March = 80% of annual funding announcements
- 27 hours downtime = 50+ users miss deadlines = brand destroyed
- Must have 99.9% SLO during peak season

**Implementation:**
- Second i9-12900K server (hot standby)
- PostgreSQL streaming replication (<5 min RPO)
- Automated failover script (<15 min RTO)
- PagerDuty 24/7 monitoring + SMS alerts
- Weekly health checks during Jan-Mar
- Chaos day testing (Dec 15-20)

**Cost vs. ROI:**
- Cost: ₩600K/month × 3 months = ₩1.8M
- ROI: Prevents ₩10-50M revenue loss from churn

### Cross-Platform Build Requirements

**⚠️ CRITICAL - ALWAYS READ THIS BEFORE DOCKER BUILDS:**

**Development Environment:** MacBook Pro M4 Max (ARM64/aarch64 architecture)
**Production Environment:** Linux server 221.164.102.253 (x86_64/amd64 architecture)

**MANDATORY BUILD COMMAND (use in ALL sessions):**
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.production -t connect:latest .
```

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Architecture Mismatch** - ARM builds on Mac will crash on x86 Linux production with missing system libraries
2. **Silent Failures** - Docker won't error during build, but containers fail at runtime with cryptic errors like:
   - `exec /usr/local/bin/node: exec format error` (wrong CPU architecture)
   - `npm ERR! missing: @prisma/client` (native bindings compiled for ARM instead of x86)
   - `libssl.so.3: cannot open shared object file` (wrong system library version)
3. **Production Impact** - Last incident: October 17, 2025 - npm EACCES errors caused 502 downtime

**Alternative: Set Default Platform (optional but recommended)**
Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
```
Then restart terminal. All future `docker build` commands will default to x86_64.

**Verification After Build:**
```bash
# Check image architecture (must show "linux/amd64")
docker inspect connect:latest --format='{{.Architecture}}'
```

**Other Requirements:**
- Multi-stage builds for optimized production images (current: ~850MB)
- Use `npm ci --production` in Docker for correct architecture bindings
- Never skip `--platform` flag even if DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM is set (explicit > implicit)

### Performance Requirements
- API response time: <500ms (P95) for MVP
- Match generation: <3 seconds for top 10 results
- Database query optimization with PgBouncer connection pooling
- Redis split: cache (LRU eviction) + queue (no eviction, AOF persistence)

### Data Freshness
- Normal: Scrape 2x daily (9am, 3pm)
- Peak Season: Scrape 4x daily (9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm)
- Change detection via content hashing
- Simple deadline extraction using regex patterns

## Database Schema Highlights

### Core Tables
- `organizations` - Companies + institutes with encrypted 사업자등록번호
- `funding_programs` - 4-agency programs with eligibility criteria
- `funding_matches` - Rule-based matches with explanations
- `users` - Authentication and subscription management
- `subscriptions` - Toss Payments integration

### New Tables (v8.0 Strategic Revision)
- `grant_outcomes` - **Proprietary data moat**: Applied, won/lost, amounts, cycle times
- `services` - Service catalog (4 types)
- `service_engagements` - Project tracking, invoice, satisfaction
- `sector_gate_checklists` - ISMS-P + KC readiness scores
- `procurement_readiness` - Scoring + gap analysis

### Privacy-Preserving Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW aggregate_success_patterns AS
SELECT 
  agency_id, industry_sector, trl_level,
  COUNT(*) as total_applications,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins,
  AVG(cycle_days) as avg_cycle_days
FROM grant_outcomes
WHERE allow_aggregate_analytics = TRUE
GROUP BY agency_id, industry_sector, trl_level
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5; -- Minimum 5 data points
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Primary: Automated GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready (October 14, 2025)  
**Architecture:** Industry-Standard Entrypoint Pattern (Heroku/AWS/K8s)

```bash
# Automated deployment (87% faster than manual)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Builds Docker images (with caching)
# 2. Runs tests + linting + security scans
# 3. SSHs to production server
# 4. Performs zero-downtime rolling update
# 5. Runs health checks (migrations happen inside containers)
# 6. Rolls back on failure
# 7. Sends notifications

# Monitor deployment progress:
# https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/connect/actions

# Verify after ~4 minutes:
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

**Architecture Pattern - Entrypoint (Industry Standard):**
- Migrations run **inside containers** on startup (not externally)
- Self-contained: Each container handles its own initialization
- Self-healing: Failed migrations = failed container = automatic rollback
- Health checks validate: Migrations + App + Endpoint (atomic validation)

**Automated Workflow Steps:**
1. **Build** - Docker image with multi-stage caching (3-4 min)
2. **Test** - TypeScript, ESLint, unit tests, security scans
3. **Deploy** - SSH to server, zero-downtime rolling update
4. **Initialize** - Containers run migrations via entrypoint script
5. **Verify** - Health checks on `/api/health` endpoint (post-migration)
6. **Rollback** - Automatic if health checks fail (30 seconds)
7. **Notify** - GitHub PR comments + email on failure

**Performance:**
- Deployment time: **4 minutes** (vs. 35 min manual)
- Build time: **3-4 minutes** (with caching)
- Transfer size: **280 MB** (vs. 1.2 GB full image)
- Zero-downtime: **Always** (blue-green rolling update)
- Code reduction: **75%** (200 lines → 50 lines vs. old external migration pattern)

**Key Files:**
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Container initialization (migrations → app)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Automated deployment pipeline
- See: [START-HERE-DEPLOYMENT-DOCS.md](./START-HERE-DEPLOYMENT-DOCS.md) for complete documentation

## Business Context (Revised Strategic Positioning)

### Target Market (Revised GTM)

**Primary: Companies (90% of revenue)**
- **Size**: 10,000+ SMEs seeking government R&D funding
- **Pain**: Don't know grants exist, miss deadlines, low win rates (15-20%)
- **Budget Authority**: Can pay ₩49-99K/month software + ₩2-7M services
- **Peak Season**: January-March (80% of announcements)
- **Why Primary**: Companies need discovery + execution support, have budget authority

**Secondary: Research Institutes (10% of revenue)**
- **Size**: 200+ institutes (95% founder network)
- **Role**: Supply-side for consortium matching (not primary customers)
- **Value**: Free platform access for partnership opportunities
- **Why Secondary**: Institutes have multi-year budgets, don't need grant "discovery"

**Critical GTM Lesson:**
- Original assumption: Research institutes = primary customers (95% network = advantage)
- Reality: Institutes don't pay for discovery (they already know their grants)
- **Pivot**: Companies = primary paying customers. Use professor network for **company introductions**, not institute signups.

### User Personas

**Company Users (Primary):**
- R&D Directors, CEOs (small companies), Business Development Managers
- Pain points: Discovery problem, deadline anxiety, low win rates (15-20%), application quality
- Jobs to be done: Discover grants, qualify eligibility, apply with quality, win funding, track outcomes
- Budget: ₩49-99K/month software + ₩2-7M services (can approve both)

**Research Institute Users (Secondary):**
- Government-funded (KIST, ETRI) or private research centers
- Pain points: Finding industry partners, tech transfer barriers, TRL matching
- Value proposition: Free platform access for consortium opportunities
- Role: Supply-side (companies need institutes as consortium partners)

### Competitive Positioning
- vs. Manual search: Automated 4-agency monitoring + explainable matching
- vs. ChatGPT (₩25,000/month): Specialized Korean R&D data + outcome intelligence
- vs. Consultants: Hybrid software + services (consultants can't scale, SaaS can't deliver expertise)
- **Unique moats**: Outcome data, services layer, network effects, compliance (off-budget)

### Pricing Strategy
- **Beta (First 50)**: ₩4,900/month for 30 days → Auto-upgrade to ₩49,000
- **Free**: ₩0/month, 10 matches/month (freemium funnel)
- **Pro**: ₩49,000/month (sustainable pricing, covers infrastructure)
- **Team**: ₩99,000/month (5 seats, for larger teams)
- **Services**: ₩2-7M per engagement (off-budget invoicing, company operating budget only)

### Success Metrics (Revised)
- **Launch**: 50 beta users (45 companies, 5 institutes) by Week 9
- **Public**: 500 users by Month 4
- **Engagement**: 70%+ weekly active, >4.0 match quality rating
- **Retention**: 70%+ after 3 months (gate for 1,000 user expansion)
- **Conversion**: 25%+ Free → Pro within 30 days
- **Revenue**: ₩10M+/month by Month 4 (software + services), ₩200M cumulative by Month 6
- **Outcome tracking**: >60% opt-in rate for sharing application results

## Critical Constraints & Requirements

1. **Companies-first GTM** - Primary paying customers, not research institutes
2. **Hybrid revenue model** - Software + services, profitable Month 1
3. **Off-budget services invoicing** - Legal compliance, customer protection
4. **Honest claims** - 200-500 active programs + 108K historical patterns (not "100K+ programs")
5. **Hot standby for peak season** - 99.9% SLO during Jan-March
6. **Outcome data collection** - PIPA-compliant, opt-in, aggregate-only
7. **Sector gates** - ISMS-P, KC prevent ineligible applications
8. **Single-server optimization** - Leverage 128GB RAM, 16 cores efficiently
9. **Respect agency websites** - Follow robots.txt, rate limiting (10 req/min)
10. **Docker for production** - Operational simplicity and reliability

---

**Summary**: Connect is not a grant discovery tool. Connect is Korea's R&D commercialization operating system, combining software automation with professional services to help companies discover, apply for, and win government funding. The hybrid business model (software + services) ensures profitability from Month 1 while building defensible competitive advantages through proprietary outcome data.
