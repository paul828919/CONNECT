## 🎯 Your First Deployment (Right Now!)

### **Step 1: Set Password (One-Time)**

```bash
# In your terminal:
export CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD='iw237877^^'

# Or add to ~/.zshrc (permanent):
echo "export CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD='iw237877^^'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### **Step 2: Check Current Health**

```bash
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect
./scripts/check-health.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Container Status: All running
✅ Application Health: app1, app2 healthy
✅ Database Status: Accepting connections
✅ Redis Status: Responding
✅ System Resources: Normal
```

### **Step 3: Make a Small Change (Practice)**

```bash
# Add a comment to any file (safe practice deployment)
echo "// Test deployment - $(date)" >> app/api/health/route.ts

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "test: practice deployment"
```

### **Step 4: Deploy!**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

**What Will Happen:**
```
1. 🔐 SSH connection check (5 sec)
2. 🔍 Pre-flight checks (10 sec)
3. 🏗️  Build on your M4 Max (60 sec)
4. 📤 Upload to server (40 sec)
5. 💾 Check migrations (10 sec)
6. 🔄 Blue-Green deploy (60 sec)
7. ✅ Health verification (20 sec)
8. 📊 Summary

Total: ~3 minutes
Downtime: 0 seconds
```

### **Step 5: Verify Success**

```bash
# Check health again
./scripts/check-health.sh

# Should show:
# ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ✅
```

### **Step 6: Practice Rollback (Optional)**

```bash
# Try rolling back (safe - just switches versions)
./scripts/rollback-production.sh

# Type 'ROLLBACK' when prompted
# Completes in < 30 seconds
```

## 📚 What Each Script Does

### **deploy-production.sh**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

**Purpose:** Deploy new version to production with zero downtime

**Steps:**
1. ✅ SSH connection test
2. ✅ Check disk space, files
3. ✅ Build Docker image (on your fast M4 Max!)
4. ✅ Upload to server (740 Mbps = fast)
5. ✅ Run database migrations (with auto-backup)
6. ✅ Deploy to GREEN container (app2)
7. ✅ Switch traffic to GREEN
8. ✅ Deploy to BLUE container (app1)
9. ✅ Balance traffic across both
10. ✅ Verify health, show summary

**When to Use:**
- Weekly feature deployments
- Bug fixes
- Any code changes

**Safety Features:**
- Automatic database backup before migration
- Health checks before traffic switch
- Rollback if any step fails
- Clear error messages

---

### **rollback-production.sh**

```bash
./scripts/rollback-production.sh
```

**Purpose:** Emergency rollback to previous version

**3 Rollback Methods:**

**Method 1: Instant Traffic Switch (< 5 sec)**
- If HAProxy is running
- Just switches which container serves traffic
- Previous version already running (from Blue-Green)
- **Fastest!**

**Method 2: Image Rollback (~30 sec)**
- Reverts Docker image to previous version
- Restarts both containers
- Use if traffic switch not possible

**Method 3: Database Rollback (~5 min)**
- Optional: Restore database from backup
- Only if migration caused issues
- **Use carefully!**

**When to Use:**
- Users reporting errors
- Monitoring shows high error rate
- Critical feature broken
- "Oh no, I deployed a bug!"

---

### **check-health.sh**

```bash
./scripts/check-health.sh
```

**Purpose:** Quick health check of entire system

**Checks:**
- 📦 Container status (running? healthy?)
- 🌐 Application health (app1, app2, public endpoint)
- 💾 Database (PostgreSQL connections, size)
- 🔴 Redis (memory usage, responding?)
- 💻 System resources (CPU, RAM, disk)
- 📋 Recent errors (last 5 minutes)
- 🔀 Traffic distribution (which container serving?)

**When to Use:**
- Before deployment (baseline check)
- After deployment (verify success)
- Daily morning check
- When users report issues
- Anytime you're worried

**Duration:** 10 seconds  
**No Changes:** Completely safe, read-only

## 🎓 Educational: How Blue-Green Works

### **Before Deployment**

```
Users → HAProxy → ┌─────────┐
                   │  app1   │ Version 1.0 (BLUE)
                   └─────────┘
                   ┌─────────┐
                   │  app2   │ Version 1.0 (GREEN - backup)
                   └─────────┘
```

### **During Deployment**

```
Step 1: Deploy to GREEN
Users → HAProxy → ┌─────────┐
                   │  app1   │ Version 1.0 (BLUE - serving users)
                   └─────────┘
                   ┌─────────┐
                   │  app2   │ Version 1.1 (GREEN - updating...)
                   └─────────┘

Step 2: Switch traffic
Users → HAProxy → ┌─────────┐
                   │  app1   │ Version 1.0 (BLUE - backup)
                   └─────────┘
                   ┌─────────┐
                   │  app2   │ Version 1.1 (GREEN - NOW SERVING!)
                   └─────────┘

Step 3: Update BLUE
Users → HAProxy → ┌─────────┐
                   │  app1   │ Version 1.1 (BLUE - updating...)
                   └─────────┘
                   ┌─────────┐
                   │  app2   │ Version 1.1 (GREEN - serving users)
                   └─────────┘
```

### **After Deployment**

```
Users → HAProxy → ┌─────────┐
         ↓         │  app1   │ Version 1.1 (BLUE)
       50/50       └─────────┘
         ↓         ┌─────────┐
                   │  app2   │ Version 1.1 (GREEN)
                   └─────────┘
                   
Both serving traffic, load balanced!
```

**Why This is Powerful:**
- ✅ Zero downtime (users never see "down")
- ✅ Instant rollback (switch back if problems)
- ✅ Test new version (deploy to GREEN, verify, then switch)
- ✅ Safe (always have previous version running)
