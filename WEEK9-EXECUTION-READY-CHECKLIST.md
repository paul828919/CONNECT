- [x] NextAuth cookie flags explicitly configured (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax)

### Beta Preparation ‚úÖ
- [x] Test organization seeding script (scripts/seed-test-orgs.ts)
- [x] Beta onboarding documentation (docs/beta/README.md)

### Monitoring ‚úÖ
- [x] Grafana alert note added (cache hit rate <60%)

## üìã Week 9, Day 1: Pre-launch Validation

### 1. Infrastructure Check (5 min)
```bash
# Check Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Check PostgreSQL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec postgres pg_isready

# Check Redis
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec redis-cache redis-cli PING
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] All services running (app1, app2, postgres, redis-cache, nginx)
- [ ] PostgreSQL: "accepting connections"
- [ ] Redis: "PONG"

---

### 2. Database Seeding (2 min)
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-orgs.ts
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] 5 test organizations created
- [ ] No errors
- [ ] Output shows "‚úÖ Successfully seeded 5 test organizations!"

---

### 3. Cache Warming (2 min)
```bash
curl -X POST https://connectplt.kr/api/admin/cache-warming \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strategy": "smart"}'
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] HTTP 200 response
- [ ] `keysWarmed` > 0
- [ ] `duration` < 5000ms

---

### 4. Security Validation (3 min)

**CSP Header:**
```bash
curl -I https://connectplt.kr | grep -i content-security-policy
```
- [ ] CSP header present with `default-src 'self'`

**Cookie Security:**
```bash
curl -I https://connectplt.kr/api/auth/session | grep -i set-cookie
```
- [ ] Cookie includes `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`

**Rate Limiting:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/example-with-ratelimit
```
- [ ] Headers include `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`

---

### 5. E2E Tests (10 min)
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://connectplt.kr npm run test:e2e
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Homepage tests: PASS
- [ ] Auth flow tests: PASS
- [ ] Dashboard tests: PASS
- [ ] No failing tests

---

### 6. Load Testing (10 min)
```bash
k6 run __tests__/performance/smoke-test.js
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] P95 latency < 500ms (target: 2000ms)
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] All checks passing

---

### 7. Cache Performance (2 min)
```bash
curl https://connectplt.kr/api/admin/cache-dashboard | jq '.summary'
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Hit rate > 40% (cold start)
- [ ] No cache errors
- [ ] Keys cached > 0

---

## üéØ Success Criteria (ALL MUST PASS)

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] All services running
- [ ] PostgreSQL accepting connections
- [ ] Redis operational

**Security:**
- [ ] CSP header configured
- [ ] Cookie security enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting operational

**Data:**
- [ ] Test organizations seeded
- [ ] Cache warmed
- [ ] No database errors

**Testing:**
- [ ] E2E tests passing
- [ ] Load tests passing
- [ ] No critical errors

**Performance:**
- [ ] P95 < 500ms (smoke test)
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 40%
- [ ] Error rate < 1%

---

## üìä Week 9, Day 2: Internal Testing

**Tasks:**
- Manual testing with test organizations
- Match generation verification
- AI explanation verification
- Dashboard functionality testing
- Beta documentation review

**Outcome:**
- [ ] All features working as expected
- [ ] No critical bugs discovered
- [ ] Ready for Week 11-12 production deployment

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Validation

**If ALL checks pass:**
‚úÖ Proceed to Week 9, Day 2 internal testing

**If ANY check fails:**
‚ùå Debug and fix issues before proceeding
- Check logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs app1`
- Review error messages
- Consult deployment documentation
