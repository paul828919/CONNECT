# 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED - Health Check Fix

## TL;DR - What Happened?

✅ **Your production system is HEALTHY**  
❌ **Your monitoring scripts had bugs**

The containers showing as "unhealthy" were actually running perfectly. The health check script was looking in the wrong places:
- Wrong ports (3000 instead of 3001/3002)
- Wrong Redis container names  
- Wrong status string

**Everything is fixed now - just needs deployment.**

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY THE FIX NOW

### Step 1: Run This Command
```bash
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect
export CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD='iw237877^^'
./scripts/deploy-health-fix.sh
```

**Time**: 2-3 minutes  
**Downtime**: Zero (rolling restart)

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked

### After deployment completes, run:
```bash
./scripts/check-health.sh
```

### You should see:
```
✅ app1: Healthy
✅ app2: Healthy
✅ Public endpoint: Healthy
✅ Redis Cache: Responding
✅ Redis Queue: Responding

✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ✅
```

### Test Individual Services
```bash
# Test app1 health
sshpass -p "$CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD" ssh user@221.164.102.253 \
  "docker exec connect_app1 curl http://localhost:3001/api/health" | jq

# Test app2 health
sshpass -p "$CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD" ssh user@221.164.102.253 \
  "docker exec connect_app2 curl http://localhost:3002/api/health" | jq

# Test public endpoint
curl -k https://221.164.102.253/api/health | jq
```

## 🛠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Check Deployment Logs
```bash
ssh user@221.164.102.253 "docker logs connect_app1 --tail 50"
```

### Run Full Diagnostics
```bash
./scripts/diagnose-production.sh
```

### Manual Rollback (if needed)
```bash
ssh user@221.164.102.253
cd /root/connect
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart app1 app2
```

## 📊 Technical Summary

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| App health failing | Wrong ports (3000 vs 3001/3002) | Updated to correct ports |
| Redis failing | Wrong container name | Changed to correct names (cache/queue) |
| Status check failing | Wrong string match | Fixed grep pattern |
| No real checks | Static "ok" response | Added DB + Redis connectivity tests |

---

## 🎯 ONE MORE TIME - WHAT TO DO

### Just run this:
```bash
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect
export CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD='iw237877^^'
./scripts/deploy-health-fix.sh
```

### Then verify:
```bash
./scripts/check-health.sh
```

**That's it! 🎉**
