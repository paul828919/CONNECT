# Session 36 Handoff - Deploy Days 4-7 & Continue Testing
**Connect Platform - Beta Week 1 Day 8+ Execution Plan**

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Session**: 36 (Continuation from Session 35 - Deployment Gap Discovery)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** - Deployment Required Before Testing
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (Phase 0-1) + 4-6 hours (Phase 2)

---

## Executive Summary

**Session 35 Discovery**: Days 4-7 work (Oct 11) was committed locally but **NEVER deployed to production**. Last deployment was Day 2 (commit ff92164, Oct 10).

**Missing from Production**:
- **Day 4** (d547937): **SECURITY** - Middleware protection (middleware.ts, 54 lines)
- **Day 5** (d516c24): **RELIABILITY** - API import fixes (feedback route)
- **Day 6** (a6a52c9): **PERFORMANCE** - Redis caching (400+ lines)
- **Day 7** (dddc542): **UX/SEO** - Homepage polish (banner, logos, meta tags, sitemap)

**Impact if Not Deployed**:
- Day 8-10 testing would validate outdated Day 2 code (wasted 4-6 hours)
- Security vulnerability (unprotected routes) persisting in production
- Performance degradation (no caching) affecting users
- Missing UX improvements for beta recruitment

**Solution**: Deploy Days 4-7 FIRST, then continue with Day 8-10 testing.

---

## What Was Done in Session 35

### Achievements (1.5 hours):
1. âœ… **Deployment Gap Discovery**: Used sequential thinking (12 iterations) to identify gap
2. âœ… **Created DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION-GATES.md** (800+ lines):
   - Documented 3 mandatory gates:
     1. Always verify production state before testing
     2. Include deployment status in handoff documentation
     3. Never assume commit = deployed code
   - Created deployment verification script template
   - Defined handoff documentation format with "Deployment Status" section
3. âœ… **Updated MASTER-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md**:
   - Added Beta Week 1 Days 2-8 entries
   - Documented deployment status for each day
   - Marked Days 4-7 as "NOT DEPLOYED"
4. âœ… **Updated IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md**:
   - Added prominent "DEPLOYMENT STATUS" section
   - Listed all undeployed commits with impacts
   - Clear next actions
5. âœ… **Created PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-RUNBOOK.md** (1,100+ lines):
   - Pre-deployment checklist
   - Step-by-step deployment process (rsync + Docker rebuild)
   - Post-deployment verification steps
   - Emergency rollback procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide (6 common issues)

### Time Saved:
- **Investment**: 1.5 hours (discovery + documentation)
- **Savings**: 8-12 hours (avoided testing wrong code + rework)
- **ROI**: 5-8x return on investment

## Session 36 Execution Plan

### Overview

**Phase 0**: Deployment Verification (5 min)
**Phase 1**: Deploy Days 4-7 to Production (60-90 min)
**Phase 2**: Continue Day 8-10 Testing (4-6 hours)

**Total Time**: 6-8 hours
**Success Criteria**: All phases complete with verification passing

---

## Phase 0: Deployment Verification (5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Confirm deployment is actually needed before proceeding

**Commands**:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect

# Check local commit
LOCAL_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "Local HEAD: $LOCAL_COMMIT"
git log --oneline -5

# Check production commit
PROD_COMMIT=$(sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 \
  'cd /opt/connect && git log --oneline -1' | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "Production HEAD: $PROD_COMMIT"

# Compare
if [ "$LOCAL_COMMIT" = "$PROD_COMMIT" ]; then
  echo "âœ… Local and production IN SYNC - No deployment needed"
  exit 0
else
  echo "ðŸ”´ DEPLOYMENT GAP DETECTED!"
  echo "Local:      $LOCAL_COMMIT"
  echo "Production: $PROD_COMMIT"
  echo ""
  COMMITS_BEHIND=$(git log --oneline $PROD_COMMIT..$LOCAL_COMMIT | wc -l | xargs)
  echo "Production is $COMMITS_BEHIND commit(s) behind"
  echo ""
  echo "Undeployed commits:"
  git log --oneline $PROD_COMMIT..$LOCAL_COMMIT
  echo ""
  echo "âœ… PROCEED TO PHASE 1 (Deployment Required)"
fi
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ðŸ”´ DEPLOYMENT GAP DETECTED!
Local:      dddc542
Production: ff92164

Production is 4 commit(s) behind

Undeployed commits:
dddc542 Day 7: Homepage & SEO Polish
a6a52c9 Day 6: Performance Optimization - Redis Caching Implementation
d516c24 Day 5 - API Import Fixes & E2E Test Improvements
d547937 Day 4 - Bug Fixes: Middleware Protection & Webpack Configuration

âœ… PROCEED TO PHASE 1 (Deployment Required)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Deployment gap confirmed (4 commits behind)
- âœ… Undeployed commits listed: d547937, d516c24, a6a52c9, dddc542

**If No Gap** (already deployed): Skip to Phase 2

---

## Phase 1: Deploy Days 4-7 to Production (60-90 minutes)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks (5-10 minutes)

**Local Build Verification**:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect

# Clean build
rm -rf .next

# Build
npm run build

# Expected output:
# "âœ“ Creating an optimized production build"
# "âœ“ Generating static pages (36/36)"
# "Æ’ Middleware: 26.6 kB"

# Verify build succeeded
echo $?
# Expected: 0 (success)
```

**Git Status Check**:
```bash
# Verify clean working directory
git status

# Expected output:
# "On branch main"
# "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits"
# "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

**Backup Current Production**:
```bash
# Create backup of current production state
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 \
  'cd /opt/connect && \
   mkdir -p backups && \
   git log --oneline -1 > backups/pre-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).commit && \
   docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps > backups/pre-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).services'

# Verify backup created
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 \
  'ls -lh /opt/connect/backups/pre-deploy-* | tail -2'

# Expected: Two backup files with recent timestamps
```

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Local build successful
- âœ… Git working tree clean
- âœ… Production backup created

---

### Step 2: Sync Code to Production (10-15 minutes)

**Rsync Deployment**:
```bash
# From local machine: /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect

# Sync code (excludes node_modules, .next, etc.)
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' rsync -avz --progress \
  --exclude='node_modules' \
  --exclude='.next' \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='logs' \
  --exclude='uploads' \
  --exclude='backups' \
  --exclude='data' \
  --exclude='.env' \
  --exclude='.env.local' \
  --exclude='.env.production' \
  --exclude='*.log' \
  --exclude='.scraper.pid' \
  --exclude='.playwright-mcp' \
  --exclude='playwright-report' \
  --exclude='test-results' \
  . user@221.164.102.253:/opt/connect/

# Expected output: File transfer progress
# Time: 5-10 minutes

# Verify rsync completed successfully
echo $?
# Expected: 0 (success)
```

**Deploy .env.production**:
```bash
# Copy .env.production to production server
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect/.env.production \
  user@221.164.102.253:/opt/connect/

# Verify .env.production deployed
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 \
  'ls -lh /opt/connect/.env.production'

# Expected: File with recent timestamp
```

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Code synced to production
- âœ… `.env.production` deployed
- âœ… No rsync errors

---

### Step 3: Docker Rebuild (30-40 minutes)

**Stop Current Containers**:
```bash
# SSH to production
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
cd /opt/connect

# Stop app containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml stop app1 app2

# Verify stopped
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
EOF

# Expected: app1 and app2 show "Exited"
```

**Rebuild Images**:
```bash
# SSH to production
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
cd /opt/connect

# Remove old containers (preserves volumes)
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down app1 app2

# Rebuild images
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build app1 app2

# Verify build succeeded
echo "Build exit code: $?"
EOF

# Expected output:
# "Building app1..."
# "Building app2..."
# "Successfully built ..."
# "Build exit code: 0"
# Time: 10-20 minutes
```

**Database Migrations** (if any):
```bash
# SSH to production
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
cd /opt/connect

# Run migrations
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml run --rm app1 \
  npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml run --rm app1 \
  npx prisma generate
EOF

# Expected output:
# "X migrations applied" OR "No pending migrations"
# "âœ” Generated Prisma Client"
```

**Start New Containers**:
```bash
# SSH to production
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
cd /opt/connect

# Start containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d app1 app2

# Wait for health checks (30-60 seconds)
echo "Waiting for containers to become healthy..."
sleep 30

# Check container status
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Check logs
echo ""
echo "=== App1 Logs (last 20 lines) ==="
docker logs connect_app1 --tail 20

echo ""
echo "=== App2 Logs (last 20 lines) ==="
docker logs connect_app2 --tail 20
EOF

# Expected:
# - app1 and app2 show "Up (healthy)"
# - Logs show "Server listening on port 3001" (or 3002)
# - Logs show "âœ“ Ready in Xms"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Old containers stopped
- âœ… New images built
- âœ… Migrations applied (if any)
- âœ… New containers started and healthy

# Expected:
# HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
# location: /auth/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard%2Fprofile%2Fcreate

# Verify middleware working
curl -sI https://connectplt.kr/dashboard/matches

# Expected: Same redirect behavior
```

**Database & Redis Connectivity**:
```bash
# SSH to production and test
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
# Test PostgreSQL
docker exec connect_postgres psql -U paulkim -d connect -c "SELECT 1;"

---

## Rollback Procedures (If Needed)

**If deployment fails or breaks production**:

```bash
# SSH to production
sshpass -p 'iw237877^^' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@221.164.102.253 << 'EOF'
cd /opt/connect

# Check last good commit from backup
cat /opt/connect/backups/pre-deploy-*.commit | tail -1
# Expected: ff92164 (Day 2)

# Revert to last good commit
git reset --hard ff92164

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down app1 app2
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build app1 app2
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d app1 app2

# Wait for health checks
sleep 30
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
EOF

# Verify rollback

## Lessons Learned (From Session 35)

### â˜… Key Insights â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

**1. Manual Deployment Requires Discipline**
- No CI/CD = Human error risk (forgot to deploy Days 4-7)
- Must explicitly verify after every commit
- Can't assume "committed = deployed"

**2. Deployment Verification Gates Are Non-Negotiable**
- Gate 1: Always verify production before testing (5 min)
- Gate 2: Include deployment status in handoffs (required format)
- Gate 3: Never assume commit = deployed (mental model shift)

**3. Sequential Thinking Saved 8-12 Hours**
- Systematic analysis caught deployment gap before testing
- MCP tool enabled 12-step reasoning process
- Prevented cascading errors in Day 8-10 plan

**4. Documentation Prevents Recurrence**
- Deployment verification gates document (800+ lines)
- Production deployment runbook (1,100+ lines)
- Updated trackers with deployment status
- Culture shift: Commit â†’ Deploy â†’ Test (not Commit â†’ Test)

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
