## ‚ö†Ô∏è Week 8: Testing & Refinement (PARTIAL - 5 items remain)

### Day 1-2: Security Hardening

#### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Rate limiting library (comprehensive Redis-based, 429 lines)
- [x] SQL injection prevention (Prisma parameterized queries)
- [x] XSS prevention (React auto-escaping)
- [x] Basic security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

#### Remaining ‚ùå
- [ ] **CSP (Content-Security-Policy) header** ‚Üí ADD to next.config.js
- [ ] **Rate limiting applied to API routes** ‚Üí SHOW example usage
- [ ] **NextAuth cookie flags explicit configuration** ‚Üí ADD httpOnly, secure, sameSite

### Day 5-6: Beta Preparation

#### Remaining ‚ùå
- [ ] **Test organization seeding** ‚Üí CREATE scripts/seed-test-orgs.ts
- [ ] **Beta onboarding documentation** ‚Üí CREATE docs/beta/README.md

## üìã Action Items for Week 9, Days 1-2

### 1. Security Enhancements (30 min)
```
File: next.config.js
- Add CSP header with strict policy
- Document existing compression (already enabled)

File: lib/auth.config.ts
- Add explicit cookie configuration (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax)

File: app/api/example-with-ratelimit/route.ts (NEW)
- Create example showing rate limiting usage
```

### 2. Beta Preparation (45 min)
```
File: scripts/seed-test-orgs.ts (NEW)
- Generate 5-10 diverse test organizations
- Industries: IT, biotech, manufacturing, energy
- Types: startups, SMEs, large corps, research institutes

File: docs/beta/README.md (NEW)
- Minimal onboarding guide
- Getting started steps
- Support channel placeholders
```

### 3. Monitoring Enhancement (15 min)
```
Add Grafana alert note to monitoring documentation:
- Alert: Cache hit rate <60%
- Severity: Warning
- Action: Run cache warming
```
