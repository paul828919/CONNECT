# 🚀 NTIS API Integration - Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated**: October 6, 2025  
**Time to Complete**: 5-10 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ Ready to Test

---

## What I've Already Done For You

✅ **Environment Configuration**: Added NTIS_API_KEY to `.env`  
✅ **Dependencies Configuration**: Updated `package.json` with axios, xml2js  
✅ **Files Verified**: All NTIS API implementation files are present  
✅ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides  
✅ **Validation Script**: Created setup validation tool

---

## Your 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect
npm install
```

**What this does**: Installs axios (HTTP client) and xml2js (XML parser) needed for NTIS API.

**Expected output**: 
```
added 3 packages, and audited 1247 packages in 15s
```

---

### Step 2: Validate Setup (1 minute)

Run the validation script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/validate-ntis-setup.ts
```

**What this does**: Checks that:
- Environment variables are set
- Dependencies are installed
- NTIS API files are valid
- Database connection works

**Expected output**:
```
✅ Validation Successful - Ready to test NTIS API!
```

**If validation fails**: Follow the fix suggestions in the output.

---

### Step 3: Test NTIS API Integration (2 minutes)

Run the test scraping:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/trigger-ntis-scraping.ts
```

**What this does**: 
- Connects to NTIS API with demo key
- Searches for R&D programs from last 30 days
- Saves programs to your database
- Shows statistics of what was found

**Expected output**:
```

## View Your Results

Open Prisma Studio to see the scraped programs:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Then open: http://localhost:5555

**What to look at**:
1. Click on `FundingProgram` table
2. Look for entries with `scrapingSource = "NTIS_API"`
3. Check the program details (title, description, budget, etc.)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### ❌ "Cannot find module 'axios'"
**Fix**: Run `npm install`

### ❌ "Cannot find module 'xml2js'"
**Fix**: Run `npm install`

### ❌ "NTIS_API_KEY is not defined"
**Fix**: Check `.env` file has this line:
```env
NTIS_API_KEY="yx6c98kg21bu649u2m8u"
```

### ❌ "Database connection failed"
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Push schema
npm run db:push
```

### ❌ "API returns 401 Unauthorized"
**Fix**: 
- The demo key might be expired
- You may need to wait for production key approval
- Check NTIS support: 042-869-1115

## What's Next?

After successful testing:

### Option 1: Wait for Production Key (Recommended)
1. ⏳ NTIS will approve your production API key (1-2 business days)
2. 📧 You'll receive the key via email
3. ✏️ Update `.env` with new key
4. ✅ Run test again with production key

### Option 2: Start Using Demo Key Now
- Demo key works for testing
- May have usage limitations
- Good for development and testing

### Option 3: Integration with Scheduler
Once you're satisfied with testing:
1. Read: `NTIS-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md` (Section: Integration with Scheduler)
2. Integrate NTIS API into your existing scheduler
3. Set up automated daily scraping
4. Monitor results
