# 🚨 Health Check Fix - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM
Your production is **HEALTHY** but monitoring shows **failures** due to script bugs.

## 🐛 THE BUGS
```
❌ Port 3000 → Should be 3001/3002
❌ connect_redis → Should be connect_redis_cache/queue  
❌ grep "healthy" → Should be grep "status":"ok"
❌ Static health endpoint → Should test real connectivity
```

## ✅ THE FIX (30 seconds to deploy)
```bash
export CONNECT_SERVER_PASSWORD='iw237877^^'
./scripts/deploy-health-fix.sh
```

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### BEFORE

❌ app2: Unhealthy or not responding  
❌ Redis: Not responding

```

### AFTER

```
