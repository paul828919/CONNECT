# CI/CD Architecture: Educational Deep Dive

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  
**Audience:** Solo developers, technical founders  
**Context:** Connect Platform - Production-grade CI/CD on a single server

---

## Introduction: Your Journey & Context

> "I'm fundamentally building my capabilities by observing your workflow and simultaneously asking questions to understand the parts I don't know."

This is **the best approach** to learning software engineering! You're doing exactly what experienced developers do:
1. **Learning by doing** (building a real product)
2. **Pattern recognition** (observing workflows)
3. **Active inquiry** (asking "why" and "how")
4. **Iterative improvement** (start simple, add complexity)

**Your Current Situation:**
- ✅ Solo developer using Cursor + Claude
- ✅ Linux server in your lab (not cloud yet)
- ✅ Building Connect platform from scratch
- ✅ Limited budget (smart! validate before scaling)
- ✅ Learning while shipping

**This is EXACTLY how successful products start.** Facebook started on a dorm room server, Stripe started with manual deployments, Airbnb deployed from a laptop. You're in good company.

## Part 1: What is CI/CD? (Simple Explanation)

### **Before We Had CI/CD (The Old Way)**

Imagine you're writing a book:
1. You write chapters on your computer
2. When done, you email the file to your publisher
3. Your publisher manually checks for typos
4. They manually format it
5. They manually upload it to Amazon
6. If there's a mistake, repeat all steps

**Problems:**
- ❌ Takes hours/days
- ❌ Human errors (forget a step)
- ❌ Inconsistent (different person = different process)
- ❌ Scary (what if you break something?)

### **With CI/CD (The Modern Way)**

Now imagine:
1. You write a chapter
2. Click "Publish"
3. **Automatic system:**
   - ✅ Checks spelling/grammar
   - ✅ Formats the book
   - ✅ Uploads to Amazon
   - ✅ Sends you confirmation
   - ✅ Rollback if error detected
4. Done in **2 minutes** instead of 2 hours

**That's CI/CD for software!**

## Part 2: CI/CD for Connect - Design Considerations

### **Questions I Asked When Designing Your CI/CD**

#### **1. What is your deployment goal?**

**Answer:** Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capability

**Why this matters:**
- You have **real users** (or will soon)
- If the site goes down, users leave
- If a bug deploys, you need to fix it immediately
- Your reputation depends on reliability

**Design Decision:**
- **Blue-Green Deployment** (two identical environments)
- Always have one version running while updating the other
- Can switch between versions in < 5 seconds

#### **2. What is your team size?**

**Answer:** Solo developer (just you)

**Why this matters:**
- You can't spend all day on deployments
- You need automation (no time for manual steps)
- You'll make mistakes when tired (automation prevents this)
- You might deploy at night (automation doesn't sleep)

**Design Decision:**
- **Fully automated deployment** (one command)
- **Clear error messages** (know what went wrong)
- **Self-service rollback** (fix mistakes quickly)

#### **3. What is your infrastructure?**

**Answer:** Single powerful server (i9-12900K, 125 GB RAM)

**Why this matters:**
- You don't have a cluster (like AWS with 100 servers)
- You need to maximize the single server
- You can't afford downtime (no redundancy)
- You have excellent hardware (use it well)

**Design Decision:**
- **Docker containers** (multiple app instances on one server)
- **HAProxy load balancer** (distribute traffic)
- **Health checks** (detect problems automatically)

#### **4. What is your risk tolerance?**

**Answer:** Low - You're building a business, not experimenting

**Why this matters:**
- A bad deployment could lose users
- Data corruption is unacceptable
- Downtime costs money and trust
- You need confidence to deploy frequently

**Design Decision:**
- **Database backups every 15 minutes**
- **Instant rollback** (< 30 seconds)
- **Automated testing** (catch bugs before deploy)
- **Gradual rollout** (Blue-Green pattern)

#### **5. What is your budget?**

**Answer:** Limited - Using lab server, not cloud (yet)

**Why this matters:**
- Cloud CI/CD services cost $50-200/month
- You're bootstrapping (every dollar matters)
- You have powerful hardware already
- You can reinvest savings into features

**Design Decision:**
- **Self-hosted** (GitHub Actions or server-based)
- **Open-source tools** (Docker, HAProxy, Grafana)
- **Efficient resource use** (one server, multiple containers)

## Part 4: Key Components Explained (In Plain English)

### **Component 1: Docker Containers**

**What it is:**
Think of Docker like shipping containers for code. Just like physical containers:
- Same container works on trucks, trains, ships
- Same Docker container works on Mac, Linux, cloud

**Why we use it:**
```
WITHOUT DOCKER (The Old Way):
❌ "Works on my machine" (but not on server)
❌ "I forgot to install Node.js on the server"
❌ "Different versions on dev vs production"

WITH DOCKER (Your Setup):
✅ Exact same environment everywhere
✅ All dependencies packaged together
✅ Isolate app from server (clean separation)
```

**Your Setup:**
- **2 app containers** (app1 & app2) - Run your Next.js app
- **1 database** (PostgreSQL) - Store data
- **1 cache** (Redis) - Speed up responses
- **1 load balancer** (HAProxy) - Distribute traffic

**Real Example:**
```bash
# Your MacBook (ARM64):
docker run connect:latest   # Runs fine

# Your server (x86_64):
docker run connect:latest   # Runs fine

# Future AWS server:
docker run connect:latest   # Will run fine
```

**Key Benefit:** Package once, run anywhere

---

### **Component 2: Blue-Green Deployment**

**What it is:**
Imagine you run a restaurant:
- **Blue kitchen** - Currently serving customers
- **Green kitchen** - Preparing new menu
- When ready, customers switch to Green kitchen
- Blue kitchen stays open (in case Green has problems)

**Visual Diagram:**
```
BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│ HAProxy  │────────▶│ Blue App │ (v1.0 - ACTIVE)
│(Traffic) │         │ (app1)   │
└──────────┘         └──────────┘
                     ┌──────────┐
                     │Green App │ (v1.0 - Backup)
                     │ (app2)   │
                     └──────────┘

DURING DEPLOYMENT:
┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│ HAProxy  │────────▶│ Blue App │ (v1.0 - ACTIVE)
│(Traffic) │         │ (app1)   │
└──────────┘         └──────────┘
                     ┌──────────┐
                     │Green App │ (v1.1 - DEPLOYING...)
                     │ (app2)   │ ← New version
                     └──────────┘

AFTER SWITCH:
┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│ HAProxy  │    ┌───▶│ Blue App │ (v1.0 - Backup)
│(Traffic) │    │    │ (app1)   │
└──────────┘    │    └──────────┘
            SWITCHED ┌──────────┐
                └───▶│Green App │ (v1.1 - ACTIVE!)
                     │ (app2)   │ ✅ New version
                     └──────────┘
```

**Why it's powerful:**
1. **Zero downtime** - Always one server running
2. **Instant rollback** - Switch back to Blue if problems
3. **Safe testing** - Deploy to Green, verify, then switch
4. **Stress-free** - Know you can undo mistakes

**Real Scenario:**
```
10:00 AM - Deploy new feature
10:01 AM - Green container starts (users still on Blue)
10:02 AM - Green is healthy, switch traffic
10:03 AM - Users now on Green (v1.1)
10:05 AM - Bug discovered! Switch back to Blue (5 seconds)
10:06 AM - Users back on v1.0 (crisis averted!)
10:30 AM - Fix bug, deploy to Green again
10:32 AM - Switch to Green (success!)
```

---

### **Component 3: Load Balancer (HAProxy)**

**What it is:**
Like a restaurant host who seats customers:
- "Table 1 is full, please sit at Table 2"
- "Table 2 is closed, everyone to Table 1"
- "Both tables ready, alternate between them"

**What HAProxy does:**
```
USER REQUEST:
User: "I want to visit connect.co.kr"
  ↓
HAProxy: "Let me check which server is best..."
  ↓
  ├─ app1 healthy? ✅ Yes (response time: 50ms)
  ├─ app2 healthy? ✅ Yes (response time: 45ms)
  └─ Decision: Send to app2 (slightly faster)
  ↓
User gets response (didn't know there were 2 servers!)
```

**Health Checks:**
```javascript
// HAProxy checks this endpoint every 2 seconds
GET /api/health

Response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": true,    // Can connect to PostgreSQL
  "redis": true,       // Can connect to Redis
  "uptime": 3600,      // 1 hour uptime
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z"
}

If this fails → HAProxy stops sending traffic to that server
```

**Real Benefit:**
- User doesn't see "server down" errors
- Automatic failover (if app1 crashes, use app2)
- Distribute load (busy times use both servers)

---

### **Component 4: Health Checks**

**What it is:**
Automatic "wellness checks" for your app:
- Like a doctor checking your pulse, temperature, reflexes
- If something's wrong, don't send patients (users) there

**Your Health Check System:**
```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Check 1: Can we reach database?
    const dbCheck = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;
    
    // Check 2: Can we reach Redis?
    const redisCheck = await redis.ping();
    
    // Check 3: Is memory usage normal?
    const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
    
    if (dbCheck && redisCheck === 'PONG' && memUsage.heapUsed < 500000000) {
      return Response.json({ status: 'healthy' });
    } else {
      return Response.json({ status: 'unhealthy' }, { status: 503 });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json({ status: 'unhealthy' }, { status: 503 });
  }
}
```

**Why it matters:**
```
WITHOUT HEALTH CHECKS:
User: "Why is the site so slow?"
You: "Let me check... oh, the database connection died 2 hours ago!"
(2 hours of bad user experience)

WITH HEALTH CHECKS:
HAProxy: "app1 health check failed, switching to app2"
Users: (No interruption, automatic switch)
You: (Get alert, fix problem without user impact)
```

---

### **Component 5: Automated Testing**

**What it is:**
Robot that checks your code before deployment:
- Like spell-check before sending an important email
- Catches 80% of bugs before users see them

**Your Test Suite:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. UNIT TESTS (142 tests)              │
│     ├─ Test matching algorithm          │
│     ├─ Test encryption functions        │
│     ├─ Test API utilities               │
│     └─ Coverage: 85%                    │
│                                          │
│  2. INTEGRATION TESTS (15 tests)        │
│     ├─ Test OAuth login flow            │
│     ├─ Test organization CRUD           │
│     ├─ Test match generation            │
│     └─ Test email sending               │
│                                          │
│  3. TYPE CHECKING (TypeScript)          │
│     ├─ Verify all types correct         │
│     ├─ No "any" types                   │
│     └─ 100% type safety                 │
│                                          │
│  4. LINTING (ESLint)                    │
│     ├─ Code style consistency           │
│     ├─ Catch common mistakes            │
│     └─ Security best practices          │
│                                          │
│  If ANY test fails → Deployment STOPS   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Real Example of Saved Disaster:**
```typescript
// You wrote this code:
function calculateMatchScore(org, program) {
  const score = org.industry === program.industr ? 100 : 0;  // TYPO!
  //                                          ^ missing 'y'
  return score;
}

// WITHOUT TESTS:
// Deploy → Users get 0 scores for all matches → Bad user experience

// WITH TESTS:
// Test runs → TypeError: Cannot read 'industr' → Deploy blocked
// You fix typo → Test passes → Deploy succeeds
```

---

### **Component 6: Database Migrations**

**What it is:**
Safe way to change database structure without losing data:
- Like renovating a house while people live in it
- Must be careful not to break things

**How Prisma Migrations Work:**
```
SCENARIO: You want to add "phone number" field to users

STEP 1 - Create Migration:
$ npx prisma migrate dev --name add_phone_number

Prisma generates:
  migration.sql:
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

STEP 2 - Test Locally:
$ npm run dev
✅ Works with new field

STEP 3 - Deploy to Production:
$ npx prisma migrate deploy
  
What happens:
  1. Prisma checks current database version
  2. Applies only NEW migrations (safe)
  3. Updates _prisma_migrations table
  4. Logs all changes
  
STEP 4 - Verify:
$ SELECT phone FROM users LIMIT 1;
✅ New column exists, existing data preserved
```

**Safety Features:**
```
1. MIGRATIONS ARE VERSIONED
   ├─ 20241001_initial_schema.sql
   ├─ 20241015_add_phone.sql
   └─ 20241020_add_address.sql
   (Always applied in order)

2. MIGRATIONS ARE REVERSIBLE
   - Keep backups before each migration
   - Can restore to any previous version
   - Rollback script included

3. MIGRATIONS ARE TESTED
   - Apply to replica database first
   - Verify data integrity
   - Then apply to primary
```

### **Component 7: Monitoring (Grafana)**

**What it is:**
Dashboard that shows your app's vital signs in real-time:
- Like fitbit for your website
- See problems before users complain

**Your Grafana Dashboards:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CONNECT PLATFORM DASHBOARD                           │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                        │

```

**Automated Alerts:**
```yaml
# When something goes wrong, you get notified:

Alert 1: High Error Rate
  Condition: error_rate > 5% for 2 minutes
  Action: Send email + Slack message
  Example: "🚨 Error rate spiked to 8%! Check logs."

Alert 2: Slow Response Time
  Condition: p95_latency > 2 seconds
  Action: Send warning
  Example: "⚠️ API responses slow (2.3s avg)"

Alert 3: Database Down
  Condition: cannot connect to PostgreSQL
  Action: Critical alert (SMS + email)
  Example: "🔴 CRITICAL: Database offline!"

Alert 4: High CPU
  Condition: cpu_usage > 90% for 5 minutes
  Action: Send warning
  Example: "⚠️ CPU at 92%, may need to scale"
```

**Why Monitoring is Critical:**
```
WITHOUT MONITORING:
User: "Your site is broken!"
You: "Oh no! When did it break? What error? Which page?"
(Slow response, bad user experience)

WITH MONITORING:
Grafana: "Error rate increased to 5%"
  (Alert sent at 10:00 AM)
You: Check dashboard → See exact error → Fix in 5 minutes
Users: Barely noticed (quick response)
```

---

## Part 5: Essential CI/CD Knowledge (Must Know)

### **1. The Deployment Pipeline (In Order)**

You MUST understand this sequence:

```
[Code] → [Build] → [Test] → [Deploy] → [Monitor] → [Rollback if needed]
```

**1.1 CODE (What you control):**
- Write code in Cursor
- Test locally (`npm run dev`)
- Commit to Git
- Push to repository

**1.2 BUILD (Automated):**
- Install dependencies
- Compile TypeScript → JavaScript
- Generate Prisma client
- Create Docker image
- **Result:** A packaged app ready to run

**1.3 TEST (Automated):**
- Run unit tests (85% coverage)
- Type check (TypeScript)
- Lint check (code quality)
- If ANY fail → STOP (don't deploy)
- **Result:** Confidence code works

**1.4 DEPLOY (Automated):**
- Upload to server
- Start new container
- Health check (10 seconds)
- Switch traffic (if healthy)
- **Result:** New version live

**1.5 MONITOR (Continuous):**
- Watch error rates
- Track response times
- Check resource usage
- Alert if problems
- **Result:** Early problem detection

**1.6 ROLLBACK (When needed):**
- Switch to previous version
- Takes < 30 seconds
- Users barely notice
- Fix bug, redeploy
- **Result:** Minimize user impact

---

### **2. Docker Basics (Simplified)**

**Essential Concepts:**

**2.1 Docker Image:**
```
What: A packaged version of your app
Like: A recipe for making a cake
Contains: Code + Dependencies + Configuration

Example:
  connect:v1.0.0 ← Version 1.0.0 of your app
  connect:v1.1.0 ← Version 1.1.0 (newer)
```

**2.2 Docker Container:**
```
What: A running instance of an image
Like: An actual cake made from the recipe
Properties: Isolated, lightweight, fast to start

Example:
  app1 ← Container running connect:v1.0.0
  app2 ← Container running connect:v1.1.0
```

**2.3 Essential Commands:**
```bash
# See running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop app1

# Start a container
docker start app1

# See logs
docker logs app1 -f

# Build image
docker build -t connect:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 connect:latest
```

---

### **3. Git Workflow (Daily Operations)**

**Essential Git Commands:**

```bash
# 1. CHECK STATUS (What changed?)
git status

# 2. ADD FILES (Stage for commit)
git add .                    # Add all files
git add app/api/route.ts     # Add specific file

# 3. COMMIT (Save changes)
git commit -m "Add new feature: user profiles"
# Good commit message: Clear, concise, explains WHAT

# 4. PUSH (Upload to GitHub)
git push origin main

# 5. CHECK HISTORY
git log --oneline

# 6. UNDO MISTAKES
git reset --soft HEAD~1      # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1      # Undo last commit (discard changes)

# 7. CREATE BRANCH (For experimental features)
git checkout -b feature/new-matching-algorithm
# Work on feature...
git checkout main            # Switch back to main
```

**Good Commit Message Examples:**
```
✅ "Fix: Match score calculation for IITP programs"
✅ "Feature: Add email notification for new matches"
✅ "Refactor: Improve database query performance"
✅ "Docs: Update deployment guide with rollback steps"

❌ "Fixed stuff"
❌ "Updates"
❌ "asdf"
```

---

### **4. Rollback Procedure (Emergency)**

**When to Rollback:**
- Error rate > 5%
- Critical feature broken
- Database migration failed
- Security vulnerability discovered

**How to Rollback (3 methods):**

**Method 1: Instant Switch (5 seconds)**
```bash
# Switch traffic to previous version
ssh user@221.164.102.253
docker exec haproxy sed -i 's/server app2 check/server app2 check backup/' /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
docker exec haproxy kill -HUP 1

# Result: Users now on app1 (old version)
```

**Method 2: Redeploy Previous Version (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Pull previous Docker image
ssh user@221.164.102.253
docker pull connect:v1.0.0
docker tag connect:v1.0.0 connect:latest
docker-compose restart app1 app2

# Result: Both containers on v1.0.0
```

**Method 3: Restore from Backup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# If database migration failed
ssh user@221.164.102.253
docker exec -i connect_postgres psql -U connect < /backups/postgres/latest.sql

# Result: Database back to previous state
```

---

### **5. Monitoring & Alerts (Stay Informed)**

**Essential Metrics to Watch:**

**5.1 Application Health:**
```
✅ Response Time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
✅ Error Rate: < 1%
✅ Uptime: > 99.5%
```

**5.2 Infrastructure Health:**
```
✅ CPU Usage: < 70%
✅ Memory Usage: < 80%
✅ Disk Space: < 80%
```

**5.3 Database Health:**
```
✅ Connection Pool: < 80% used
✅ Query Time: < 100ms (average)
✅ Replication Lag: < 1 second
```

**How to Check (Quick Commands):**
```bash
# 1. Check if app is running
curl https://221.164.102.253/api/health

# 2. Check Docker containers
ssh user@221.164.102.253 'docker ps'

# 3. Check logs for errors
ssh user@221.164.102.253 'docker logs app1 --tail 50 | grep -i error'

# 4. Check disk space
ssh user@221.164.102.253 'df -h'

# 5. Check resource usage
ssh user@221.164.102.253 'docker stats --no-stream'
```

---

### **6. Security Essentials**

**Must-Know Security Practices:**

**6.1 Environment Variables (Never commit secrets!):**
```bash
# WRONG (Never do this):
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://connect:password123@localhost:5432"  # Committed to Git 😱

# RIGHT:
# In .env.production.local (NOT in Git)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://connect:password123@localhost:5432"

# In .gitignore:
.env.production.local
.env*.local
```

**6.2 SSH Access:**
```bash
# Use SSH keys, not passwords
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "paul@connect.co.kr"
ssh-copy-id user@221.164.102.253

# Disable password authentication on server
sudo sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

**6.3 Firewall:**
```bash
# Only allow necessary ports
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
sudo ufw enable

# Block everything else
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

### **When to Move to Cloud (Checklist)**

**Don't move until you have:**

```
✅ TRACTION
   - 100+ active users
   - $1,000+ monthly revenue
   - Clear product-market fit

✅ SCALE NEEDS
   - Lab server at > 70% capacity
   - International users (latency issues)
   - Need geographic redundancy

✅ BUDGET
   - $500-1,000/month for cloud
   - Can afford AWS/GCP/Azure
   - Justified by revenue

✅ COMPLEXITY
   - Need auto-scaling
   - Need load balancing across regions
   - Need managed services

UNTIL THEN: Lab server is PERFECT! 🎉
```

**Cloud Cost Estimate:**
```
AWS Equivalent Infrastructure:
- EC2 c6i.4xlarge: $612/month
- RDS PostgreSQL: $300/month  
- ElastiCache Redis: $100/month
- Load Balancer: $20/month
- Data Transfer: $100/month
- Backups: $50/month
────────────────────────────
TOTAL: $1,182/month

Your Lab Server: $0/month (already have hardware)
───────────────────────────
SAVINGS: $1,182/month = $14,184/year!
```

**Use those savings to:**
- Hire a designer
- Marketing budget
- Your salary
- Feature development

## Part 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **Mistake 1: Deploying Without Testing**

```
❌ Bad:
git add .
git commit -m "fix"
./deploy.sh     # Hope it works! 🤞

✅ Good:
npm test                    # Run tests
npm run build              # Verify build works
npm run type-check         # No type errors
THEN deploy                # Confidence!
```

### **Mistake 2: No Rollback Plan**

```
❌ Bad:
Deploy → Something breaks → Panic → Try to fix live → More problems

✅ Good:
Deploy → Something breaks → Rollback (30 seconds) → Users OK → Fix locally → Redeploy
```

### **Mistake 3: Ignoring Monitoring**

```
❌ Bad:
Deploy → Close laptop → Go to sleep → Wake up to angry users

✅ Good:
Deploy → Watch Grafana for 10 minutes → Set up alerts → Sleep peacefully
```

### **Mistake 4: Manual Steps**

```
❌ Bad:
1. SSH to server
2. Stop container
3. Pull new code
4. Install dependencies
5. Build
6. Start container
7. Check health
8. (Forget step 3, deploy breaks)

✅ Good:
1. Run ./deploy.sh
2. (Script does all steps correctly)
3. Coffee while it deploys ☕
```

### **Mistake 5: No Backups**

```
❌ Bad:
Hard drive fails → All data lost → Business ends

✅ Good:
Automated backups every 15 minutes → Hard drive fails → Restore from backup → Back online in 10 minutes
```
