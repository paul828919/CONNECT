## 🧪 Manual Testing Required

### You need to test in browser:

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. **Click:** "카카오로 시작하기" button
3. **Login:** with Kakao account
4. **Verify:** Redirect to `/dashboard/profile/create`
5. **Fill form:** Organization details
6. **Submit:** Create profile
7. **Verify:** Redirect to `/dashboard`

**Detailed instructions:** See `OAUTH_TEST_GUIDE.md`

## 📊 Expected Flow

```
1. User visits /auth/signin
   ↓
2. Clicks "카카오로 시작하기"
   ↓
3. Redirects to Kakao OAuth (kauth.kakao.com)
   ↓
4. User logs in with Kakao
   ↓
5. Kakao redirects to /api/auth/callback/kakao?code=...
   ↓
6. NextAuth exchanges code for tokens
   ↓
7. User account created in database
   ↓
8. Session cookie set (next-auth.session-token)
   ↓
9. Redirect to /dashboard/profile/create (no org yet)
   ↓
10. User fills organization form
    ↓

    ↓
12. Business number encrypted + hashed
    ↓
13. Organization created in database
    ↓
14. User.organizationId updated

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### After manual testing, you should see:

✅ **In Browser:**
- Kakao login successful
- Profile creation form works
- Dashboard displays correctly
- User name/email shown
- Stats: 0 matches, 8 programs, Free plan

✅ **In Database:**
```sql
-- User created
SELECT email FROM users WHERE email != 'admin@connect.kr';

-- Organization created with encryption
SELECT
  name,
  length(business_number_encrypted) as enc_len,
  length(business_number_hash) as hash_len
FROM organizations
WHERE name LIKE '%테스트%';

-- Expected:
-- enc_len: 90 (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)
-- hash_len: 64 (SHA-256 hash)
```

## 🔧 If Issues Occur

### Common Issues & Fixes

1. **"Invalid client_id" on Kakao page**
   - Verify KAKAO_CLIENT_ID in .env matches Kakao Developer Console

2. **"Invalid redirect_uri"**
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/kakao` to Kakao Developer Console

3. **Session not saving**
   - Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set in .env
   - Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

4. **Business number already exists**
   - Use different number or delete test org from database

**Full troubleshooting:** See `OAUTH_TEST_GUIDE.md`
