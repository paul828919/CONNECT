- 10,000 requests/day: ‚Ç©48,800/day
- Monthly: ‚Ç©1,464,000

### With 50% Caching
- Per request (cached): ‚Ç©1.47 (90% input savings)
- Average per request: ‚Ç©3.18 (50% hit rate)
- 10,000 requests/day: ‚Ç©31,800/day
- Monthly: ‚Ç©954,000

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigation

**1. API Rate Limits (Tier 1: 50 RPM)**
- Risk: User surge exceeds rate limit
- Mitigation: Request queue, upgrade to Tier 2 if needed
- Fallback: Show cached responses, graceful degradation

**2. Cost Overruns (‚Ç©50K/day budget)**
- Risk: Inefficient prompts = high token usage
- Mitigation: Response caching (50% reduction), prompt optimization
- Fallback: Temporary feature disable if 90% budget spent

**3. Korean Quality (<70% satisfaction)**
- Risk: Unnatural Korean = user dissatisfaction
- Mitigation: Extensive prompt testing, native speaker review
- Fallback: Feedback form, rapid prompt iteration

**4. Response Latency (>2s target)**
- Risk: Slow AI responses = poor UX
- Mitigation: Streaming responses, response caching
- Fallback: Loading states, progress indicators
