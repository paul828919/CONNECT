# Week 3 Day 15: API Key Validation Status

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: NEARLY COMPLETE - Awaiting Credit Purchase

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (95%)

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅
- API key successfully added to `.env`
- All 6 environment variables configured correctly
- API key format validated: `sk-ant-api03-...`

### 2. Code Fixes Applied ✅
- **Issue**: Module-level initialization prevented environment loading
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy initialization pattern
  - `getAnthropicClient()` - Lazy Anthropic client creation
  - `getRedisClient()` - Lazy Redis client creation
- **Result**: Environment variables now load correctly with `tsx`

### 3. Test Script Enhanced ✅
- Added `dotenv.config()` to load `.env` file
- Test script now properly reads environment variables

### 4. Connectivity Test Results ✅ (Partial)
```
Test 1: Health Check
----------------------------------------
Status: healthy
API Key Configured: ✅
Redis Connected: ✅
Budget Remaining: ₩50000
Rate Limit Remaining: 50
✅ Health check passed
```

## ⚠️ Blocking Issue: Credit Balance

**Error Message**:
```
Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API.
Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.
```

**What This Means**:
- ✅ API key is VALID and authenticated
- ✅ Infrastructure is working correctly
- ❌ Account needs credits to make API calls

**API Request Details**:
- Status: 400 (Bad Request)
- Type: `invalid_request_error`
- Request ID: `req_011CTwRtjkQDsjSKtyhfgz8n`

## 📋 Next Steps for User

### Step 1: Purchase Credits (5 minutes)
1. Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans
2. Click "Buy Credits" or "Add to Balance"
3. Purchase minimum $5 USD (recommended: $10-20 for testing)
4. Wait for payment confirmation (usually instant)

### Step 2: Verify Credit Balance
1. After purchase, refresh the billing page
2. Confirm credit balance shows > $0

### Step 3: Re-run Connectivity Test
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-anthropic-connectivity.ts
```

**Expected Results After Credit Purchase**:
```
✅ Health check passed
✅ Korean request/response successful
✅ Budget tracking functional
✅ Rate limiting functional
✅ Error handling functional
✅ Domain expertise validated
🎉 AI client is ready for production use!
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### Lazy Initialization Pattern
**Before** (problematic):
```typescript
// Runs at module import time (before .env loads)
if (!process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Not configured');
}
const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });
```

**After** (fixed):
```typescript
// Runs on first use (after .env loads)
let anthropic: Anthropic | null = null;

function getAnthropicClient(): Anthropic {
  if (!anthropic) {
    if (!process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) {
      throw new Error('Not configured');
    }
    anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });
  }
  return anthropic;
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Module-level code executes during import, before `dotenv.config()`
- Lazy initialization defers validation until first actual use
- Enables proper environment variable loading with `tsx`

## 💰 Cost Projection

### Initial Testing (Day 15)
- 6 test scenarios × ~500 tokens avg = 3,000 tokens
- Cost: ~₩15-20 for complete test suite
- Negligible impact on $5 credit balance

### Daily Development (Day 16-22)
- ~100 test requests/day × 700 tokens avg = 70,000 tokens/day
- Cost: ~₩350/day = ~₩2,450/week
- Well within ₩50,000/day budget

### Production Usage (Post-Launch)
- Target: 500 users × 2 requests/day = 1,000 requests/day
- With 50% cache hit rate = 500 full requests + 500 cached
- Cost: ~₩4,880/day = ~₩146,400/month
- Within ₩2M/month budget (7.3% utilization)

## 🚀 What Happens After Credits Added

1. **Immediate**: Test suite completes successfully
2. **5 minutes**: Mark Day 15 as 100% complete
3. **Same day**: Begin Day 16-17 implementation (Match Explanation Service)
4. **Timeline impact**: Still 6 days ahead of schedule
