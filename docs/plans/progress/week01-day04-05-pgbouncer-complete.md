## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### PgBouncer Connection Pooling Architecture

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**How PgBouncer Transaction Pooling Works:**

1. **Client Connection**: Application opens connection to PgBouncer (port 6432)
2. **Transaction Start**: PgBouncer assigns available PostgreSQL connection
3. **Query Execution**: Queries run on assigned PostgreSQL connection
4. **Transaction End**: PostgreSQL connection returned to pool
5. **Connection Reuse**: Next client transaction can use same PostgreSQL connection

**Why This Matters:**
- Web applications open/close database connections frequently
- PostgreSQL connection setup is expensive (~2-5ms per new connection)
- PgBouncer maintains persistent PostgreSQL connections
- Result: 90% reduction in connection overhead
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### Pool Sizing Strategy

**Formula**: `default_pool_size = (max_active_transactions / num_app_servers)`

**Our Configuration**:
- Max client connections: 1,000
- Default pool size: 25 per database
- Reserve pool: 5 additional connections
- Total capacity: (25 + 5) × 2 databases = 60 PostgreSQL connections

**Scaling Calculation**:
- Single Next.js server: 1,000 concurrent requests → 25 PostgreSQL connections
- Peak season (Jan-Mar): 2 Next.js containers → 50 PostgreSQL connections
- PostgreSQL max_connections: 200 (plenty of headroom)

### Connection Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Next.js App   │ (1,000 clients)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐

│  Pool Manager   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ (25 connections)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL 15  │ (port 5432/5433)
│  Primary/Standby│
└─────────────────┘

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. PgBouncer vs. Prisma Connection Pooling

**Question**: Why use PgBouncer when Prisma has built-in connection pooling?

**Answer**:
- **Prisma pooling**: In-process, per-application-instance
- **PgBouncer pooling**: External, shared across all instances
- **Benefit**: Multiple Next.js containers share same PgBouncer pool
- **Result**: 2 app containers + PgBouncer = 50 connections vs. 2 app containers × 50 = 100 connections

### 2. Transaction Mode vs. Session Mode

**Chosen**: `pool_mode = transaction`

**Alternatives**:
- **Session mode**: Client gets dedicated server connection for entire session
  - Use case: Applications using session-level features (temp tables, prepared statements)
  - Drawback: Lower connection reuse (fewer concurrent clients per connection)

- **Transaction mode**: Server connection released after each transaction
  - Use case: Stateless web applications (Connect Platform ✅)
  - Benefit: Maximizes connection reuse

**Why Transaction Mode Works for Connect**:
- Next.js API routes are stateless
- Each request = single transaction
- No temp tables or session variables needed
- Perfect fit for transaction pooling

### 3. Reserve Pool Strategy

**Configuration**: `reserve_pool_size = 5`

**Purpose**: Handle traffic spikes without rejecting connections

**Example Scenario**:
- Normal load: 20 active clients → 20 of 25 pool connections used
- Traffic spike: 40 active clients → 25 main pool + 5 reserve = 30 total
- Reserve activation: Automatic when main pool exhausted
- Timeout: 3 seconds to wait for reserve connection

**Production Tuning** (January-March peak season):
```ini
default_pool_size = 50            # Increase from 25
reserve_pool_size = 10            # Increase from 5
reserve_pool_timeout = 5          # Allow 5s wait time
```

## 📝 Notes for Production Deployment

### PgBouncer Configuration Adjustments

**For Production (i9-12900K server, Linux)**:
```ini
[databases]
connect = host=primary-server.internal port=5432 dbname=connect pool_size=50 reserve_pool=10
connect_standby = host=standby-server.internal port=5433 dbname=connect pool_size=50 reserve_pool=10

[pgbouncer]
listen_addr = *                        # Listen on all interfaces (not just 127.0.0.1)
max_client_conn = 2000                 # Increase for peak season
default_pool_size = 50                 # Increase pool size
reserve_pool_size = 10                 # Larger reserve pool
```

### Security Hardening

**1. Use Stronger Authentication**:
```ini
auth_type = scram-sha-256              # Instead of md5
```

**2. Enable TLS**:
```ini
client_tls_sslmode = require
client_tls_key_file = /path/to/server.key
client_tls_cert_file = /path/to/server.crt

server_tls_sslmode = require
```

**3. Restrict Listening Address** (after testing):
```ini
listen_addr = 172.25.0.0/16            # Docker network only
```

### Monitoring Integration

**Grafana Dashboard**:
- PgBouncer stats endpoint: `SHOW STATS;`
- Metrics to track:
  - `cl_active`: Active client connections
  - `cl_waiting`: Clients waiting for connection
  - `sv_active`: Active server connections
  - `sv_idle`: Idle server connections in pool
  - `maxwait`: Maximum wait time for connection

**Alerting Thresholds**:
- `cl_waiting > 10`: Pool exhausted, increase pool size
- `maxwait > 5s`: Clients waiting too long
- `avg_query > 1s`: Slow queries detected

### Peak Season Optimization (January-March)

**Expected Load**:
- Users: 1,000+ concurrent
- Requests: 10,000+ per minute
- Database queries: 50,000+ per minute

**Recommended Settings**:
```ini
max_client_conn = 5000                 # Handle 1,000+ users
default_pool_size = 100                # 2x increase
reserve_pool_size = 20                 # 4x increase
max_db_connections = 150               # Per-database limit
```

**Monitoring Frequency**:
- Increase stats_period from 60s to 10s
- Real-time Grafana dashboard
- PagerDuty alerts for pool exhaustion
