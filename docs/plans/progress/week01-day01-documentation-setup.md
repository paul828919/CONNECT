**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Files Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added 12-week execution plan section
  - Timeline overview
  - Reference to master plan
  - Current week tracking
- `docs/current/PRD_v8.0.md`: Updated launch timeline
  - Changed launch date to January 1, 2026
  - Added implementation plan reference
  - Updated critical milestones

### 3. Created Implementation Status Dashboard
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Files Created**:
- `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` (root level)
  - Real-time status tracking
  - Current week/day indicator
  - Progress tables for all 12 weeks
  - Quick links to documentation
  - Known issues tracking
  - Success metrics checklist

### 4. Established Progress Tracking System
**Time Spent**: 15 minutes
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Directories Created**:
- `docs/plans/progress/` - Daily progress logs directory

**Files Created**:
- `docs/plans/progress/week01-day01-documentation-setup.md` (this file)

---

## üìä Summary Statistics

**Total Time**: 2.75 hours
**Files Created**: 3 new files
**Files Modified**: 2 existing files
**Directories Created**: 2 new directories
**Lines of Code/Docs**: ~2,500 lines

## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. Documentation Structure
**Decision**: Three-tier documentation approach
- **Master Plan**: Single comprehensive source (`EXECUTION-PLAN-MASTER.md`)
- **Status Dashboard**: Real-time quick reference (`IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`)
- **Daily Logs**: Detailed progress tracking (`docs/plans/progress/`)

**Rationale**: Balances comprehensiveness with accessibility. Master plan for detail, status dashboard for quick checks, daily logs for historical tracking.

### 2. Timeline Commitment
**Decision**: January 1, 2026 launch date (12 weeks from Oct 9)
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with peak season (Jan-March for R&D funding)
- Provides 4 full weeks for beta testing (critical)
- Hot standby infrastructure ready for 99.9% SLO requirement

### 3. Daily Progress Documentation
**Decision**: Create individual progress files for each day/major milestone
**Rationale**: Enables clear historical tracking, easy reference for retrospectives, and accountability for progress.

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today - Oct 9 Evening)
1. **Begin Week 1 Day 1 Technical Implementation**
   - Task: Configure PostgreSQL primary server
   - File to create: `config/postgresql/primary.conf`
   - Expected time: 2 hours
   - Success criteria: Replication configured, replication user created

### Tomorrow (Oct 10)
1. **Set up PostgreSQL Standby Server**
   - Task: Create base backup and configure standby
   - Expected time: 2-3 hours
   - Success criteria: Streaming replication working, lag <1 second

### This Week Remaining
1. Day 3: Replication monitoring scripts
2. Day 4-5: PgBouncer connection pooling
3. Day 6-7: Monitoring dashboard and Week 1 validation

---

## üìä Metrics

### Progress Tracking
- **Overall Plan Progress**: 3% (documentation setup complete)
- **Week 1 Progress**: 15% (planning phase complete, technical work begins)
- **Days Until Launch**: 83 days remaining

### Success Criteria - Documentation Phase
- [x] Master execution plan created with day-by-day tasks
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with execution plan reference
- [x] PRD updated with new timeline
- [x] Status dashboard operational
- [x] Progress tracking system established
- [x] All files committed to git (pending)

---

## üéØ Validation Checklist

- [x] `docs/plans/EXECUTION-PLAN-MASTER.md` exists and is comprehensive
- [x] `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` created at project root
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` references execution plan
- [x] `PRD_v8.0.md` reflects January 1, 2026 launch
- [x] Progress tracking directory created
- [x] This progress file documents today's work
- [ ] All changes committed to git (next step)

## üí° Insights & Learnings

1. **Comprehensive Planning Pays Off**: Taking time to create detailed day-by-day plans reduces decision fatigue during implementation and ensures nothing is forgotten.

2. **Three-Tier Documentation**: Having a master plan, status dashboard, and daily logs provides the right level of detail for different use cases (planning vs. tracking vs. historical reference).

3. **Checkpoint-Based Progress**: Breaking 12 weeks into daily checkpoints makes the massive scope feel manageable and provides clear progress indicators.
