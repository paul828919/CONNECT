## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Should I Fix This Now?
```
P0 (Blocks usage) → Fix IMMEDIATELY (within 4 hours)
P1 (Degrades experience) → Fix today/tomorrow
P2 (Minor issue) → Fix during weekend or defer
P3 (Cosmetic) → Defer to post-launch
```

### Should I Skip Beta Testing?
```
NO. NEVER. 

Beta testing is your SAFETY NET.
Skipping beta = launching blind = high risk of public failure.
```

### Should I Delay Launch?
```
If on Dec 22:
- Any Technical Validation metric fails → DELAY to Jan 15
- More than 2 Product Validation metrics fail → DELAY to Jan 15
- More than 3 critical bugs unresolved → DELAY to Jan 15
- Founder confidence LOW → DELAY to Jan 15

Otherwise: LAUNCH on Jan 1 with confidence! 🚀
```

## 💡 Quick Wins & Tips

**Time Management**:
- Solo founder: 30-45 hours/week average
- Beta support: 20-30 hours/week (manageable)
- Take weekends off (you deserve it!)

**Stress Management**:
- Beta is only 5 users, not 500 (low stress)
- Every bug found in beta = disaster avoided at launch
- Celebrate small wins (first user! first testimonial!)

**Recruitment Tips**:
- Start 2 weeks early (Nov 1, not Nov 15)
- Target market, not personal network
- Offer compelling value (30 days free + 50% off forever)
- Lower friction (no payment info required upfront)

**Docker Tips**:
- Practice in staging first (break things safely)
- Document rollback procedure (test it!)
- Monitor logs actively (first 24 hours critical)
