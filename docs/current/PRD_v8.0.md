# CONNECT – Product Requirements Document (PRD) v8.0

**Version:** 8.0 (Final Strategic Revision)
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Production Ready - Strategic Pivot Complete
**Scope:** MVP Platform for Korea's R&D Commercialization Ecosystem

---

## Executive Summary

CONNECT transforms from a "grant discovery platform" to **Korea's complete R&D commercialization operating system**. The MVP focuses on **4 critical funding agencies** covering ~55% of Korea's R&D budget, with a hybrid software + services business model targeting **companies first** (research institutes as secondary supply-side).

**Key Strategic Changes in v8.0 (Final Revision):**
- **GTM Pivot**: Companies (primary paying customers) → Research institutes (supply-side for consortium matching)
- **Business Model**: Software + services hybrid (services provide immediate cash flow + defensible moat)
- **Pricing Update**: ₩49,000-69,000/month (sustainable) + services revenue (₩2-7M per engagement)
- **Data Moat**: Proprietary outcome tracking (win rates, cycle times) creates defensible competitive advantage
- **Compliance**: Off-budget services invoicing (legal compliance with R&D cost regulations)
- **Claims Discipline**: Honest expectations (200-500 active programs + 108K historical for patterns)

## 1. Product Vision & Strategy

### 1.1 Vision Statement
Enable Korean companies to efficiently discover, apply for, and win government R&D funding through intelligent matching, automated monitoring, and execution support services.

### 1.2 Strategic Positioning

**Primary Value Proposition:**
- **For Companies**: Complete R&D commercialization support (discovery → application → winning)
- **Vs. Manual Search**: Automated 4-agency monitoring + explainable matching
- **Vs. Generic AI** (ChatGPT ₩25,000/month): Verified Korean R&D data + outcome intelligence
- **Vs. Consultants**: Software enables scale + services provide expertise (hybrid advantage)

**Unique Moats:**
1. **Proprietary Outcome Data**: Win rates, cycle times, success patterns (competitors lack this)
2. **Services Layer**: Consultants can't scale software, SaaS can't deliver expertise (we do both)
3. **Network Effects**: More users → more outcome data → better matching
4. **Compliance**: Off-budget invoicing structure prevents customer audit risk

### 1.3 Target Market (Revised GTM)

**Primary Target: Companies (90% of revenue)**
- **Size**: 10,000+ SMEs seeking government R&D funding
- **Pain Point**: Don't know which grants exist, miss deadlines, low win rates (15-20%)
- **Budget Authority**: Can pay for software (₩49K-99K/month) + services (₩2-7M per project)
- **Peak Season**: January-March (80% of corporate funding announcements)
- **Initial Launch**: 50 beta users → 500 users → 1,000 users (if 70%+ retention)

**Secondary Target: Research Institutes (10% of revenue)**
- **Size**: 200+ institutes (95% founder network coverage)
- **Role**: Supply-side for consortium matching (not primary paying customers)
- **Value**: Free platform access in exchange for consortium partnership opportunities
- **Why Secondary**: Institutes don't need grant "discovery" (they have multi-year budgets)

**GTM Lesson Learned:**
Original PRD assumed research institutes would be primary customers (95% network = advantage). 
Reality: Research institutes don't pay for discovery (they already know their grants).
**Pivot**: Companies are primary paying customers. Use professor network for **company introductions**, not institute signups.

### 1.4 Revenue Model (Hybrid: Software + Services)

**Software Revenue (Subscription SaaS):**
- Pro: ₩49,000/month (companies, individual users)
- Team: ₩99,000/month (5 seats, for larger teams)
- Target: 140 paying users by Month 6 → ₩6.86M/month recurring

**Services Revenue (High-margin consulting):**
- Application review: ₩2-3M per project
- Certification planning: ₩3-5M per project
- Consortium formation: ₩3-5M per project
- TRL advancement consulting: ₩5-7M per project
- Target: 10 services engagements by Month 6 → ₩30-50M one-time

**Why Hybrid Model:**
1. **Immediate Cash Flow**: Services provide ₩25M+ revenue from Month 1 (vs. waiting for MRR buildup)
2. **Sustainable Pricing**: ₩49K-99K software pricing covers infrastructure costs
3. **Defensible Moat**: Competitors can't easily replicate services expertise
4. **Customer Success**: Services help customers win grants → positive outcome data → better matching
5. **Profitability**: Breaks even Month 1 (vs. Month 8+ with software-only model)

**Total Revenue Projection (Month 6):**
- Software: ₩6.86M/month (140 Pro/Team users)
- Services: ₩30-50M (10 engagements)
- **Total: ₩200M cumulative by Month 6**

---

## 2. User Personas (2 Core Types)

### 2.1 Company Users (기업) - PRIMARY PAYING CUSTOMERS

**Profile:**
- Seeking R&D funding for technology development and commercialization
- Business structure: 90% 법인 (Corporate), 10% 개인사업자 (Sole Proprietorship)
- Decision makers: R&D Directors, CEOs (small companies), Business Development Managers
- Budget authority: Can approve ₩49-99K/month software + ₩2-7M services

**Pain Points (Critical):**
1. **Discovery Problem**: Don't know which grants exist, scattered across 4+ agency websites
2. **Deadline Anxiety**: Miss opportunities due to poor tracking (50% of missed grants)
3. **Eligibility Confusion**: Complex requirements (TRL, certifications, revenue caps) hard to understand
4. **Low Win Rates**: 15-20% success rate (vs. 25-35% with proper support)
5. **Application Quality**: First-time applicants lack experience writing winning proposals
6. **Consortium Formation**: Can't find partners, or find wrong partners (mismatch)

**Primary Needs:**
1. Automated monitoring of 4 major agencies (save 10+ hours/month)
2. Simple eligibility matching (avoid wasting time on ineligible grants)
3. Deadline reminders (7-day, 3-day, 1-day alerts)
4. Application review services (increase win rate by 10-15 percentage points)
5. Partner introductions for consortium requirements

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- **Discover**: Find relevant grants without manual website checking
- **Qualify**: Understand if my company is eligible before applying
- **Apply**: Submit high-quality application with competitive advantage
- **Win**: Maximize selection probability through professional support
- **Track**: Know application status and outcomes

### 2.2 Research Institute Users (연구소) - SUPPLY-SIDE (FREE TIER)

**Profile:**
- Multi-year R&D budgets aligned to national priorities
- Types: Government-funded institutes (KIST, ETRI, etc.), private research centers
- Strong network advantage: 95% of founder's contacts

**Pain Points:**
- Finding industry partners for applied research and commercialization
- Tech transfer barriers (companies don't know institute capabilities)
- Matching with companies at appropriate TRL levels

**Value Proposition (Free Platform Access):**
- Discover companies seeking consortium partners
- Showcase research capabilities and technologies
- Connect with companies for joint R&D projects
- Access to applied research funding opportunities

**Why Free?**
Research institutes don't need grant "discovery" (they have multi-year government budgets).
Their value to Connect: Supply-side for consortium matching (companies need institutes as partners).
Platform facilitates both sides: Companies find grants → Companies find institute partners → Institutes get commercialization opportunities.

```javascript
function calculateMatch(organization, fundingProgram) {
  let score = 0;
  let explanation = [];
  let blockedReasons = [];
  let warningReasons = [];
  
  // === ELIGIBILITY GATES (PASS/FAIL) ===
  
  // Gate 1: Organization type
  if (organization.type !== fundingProgram.targetType && fundingProgram.targetType !== 'both') {
    return { 
      score: 0, 
      passesEligibility: false,
      blockedReasons: ["지원 대상이 아닙니다"] 
    };
  }
  
  // Gate 2: TRL range (strict)
  if (organization.trl < fundingProgram.minTRL - 2 || organization.trl > fundingProgram.maxTRL + 2) {
    blockedReasons.push(`TRL 범위 불일치: 귀사 TRL ${organization.trl}, 요구 TRL ${fundingProgram.minTRL}-${fundingProgram.maxTRL}`);
    return { score: 0, passesEligibility: false, blockedReasons };
  }
  
  // Gate 3: Sector-specific requirements
  if (fundingProgram.requiresISMS && !organization.hasISMSCert) {
    blockedReasons.push("ISMS-P 인증 필수 (미보유)");
    return { score: 0, passesEligibility: false, blockedReasons };
  }
  
  if (fundingProgram.requiresKC && !organization.hasKCCert) {
    blockedReasons.push("KC 인증 필수 (미보유)");
    return { score: 0, passesEligibility: false, blockedReasons };
  }
  
  // === SCORING (IF PASSES GATES) ===
  
  // Industry match (30 points)
  if (organization.industrySector === fundingProgram.targetIndustry) {
    score += 30;
    explanation.push("산업 분야가 과제 요구사항과 일치합니다");
  } else if (isSimilarIndustry(organization.industrySector, fundingProgram.targetIndustry)) {
    score += 15;
    explanation.push("유사 산업 분야입니다");
    warningReasons.push("산업 분야가 정확히 일치하지는 않습니다");
  }
  
  // TRL matching (20 points)
  if (organization.trl >= fundingProgram.minTRL && organization.trl <= fundingProgram.maxTRL) {
    score += 20;
    explanation.push(`기술 준비 수준(TRL ${organization.trl})이 과제 요구사항(TRL ${fundingProgram.minTRL}-${fundingProgram.maxTRL})과 완벽히 일치합니다`);
  } else if (Math.abs(organization.trl - fundingProgram.minTRL) <= 1) {
    score += 10;
    explanation.push(`TRL ${organization.trl}이 요구 범위에 근접합니다`);
    warningReasons.push("TRL 상향 필요 여부 검토 필요");
  }
  
  // Certifications (20 points)
  let certScore = 0;
  if (fundingProgram.requiresISMS && organization.hasISMSCert) {
    certScore += 10;
    explanation.push("ISMS-P 인증 보유 (필수 요건 충족)");
  }
  if (fundingProgram.requiresKC && organization.hasKCCert) {
    certScore += 10;
    explanation.push("KC 인증 보유 (필수 요건 충족)");
  }
  if (organization.hasISO9001) {
    certScore += 5;
    explanation.push("ISO 9001 인증 보유 (추가 가점)");
  }
  score += Math.min(20, certScore);
  
  // Budget fit (15 points)
  if (organization.revenueRange === fundingProgram.targetRevenueRange) {
    score += 15;
    explanation.push("예산 규모가 귀사에 적합합니다");
  }
  
  // R&D Experience (15 points)
  if (organization.hasRdExperience) {
    score += 15;
    explanation.push("R&D 경험 보유 (선정 가능성 향상)");
  } else {
    score += 7;
    explanation.push("R&D 경험 미보유 (첫 과제 신청 가능)");
  }
  
  return { 
    score, 
    explanation, 
    passesEligibility: true,
    blockedReasons,
    warningReasons
  };
}
```

#### 3.3 Agency Monitoring (4 Agencies - Hybrid Approach)

**Covered Agencies:**
1. **IITP** (정보통신기획평가원) - ICT sector, ~15% of budget
2. **KEIT** (한국산업기술평가관리원) - Industrial tech, ~12% of budget
3. **TIPA** (중소기업기술정보진흥원) - SME support, ~8% of budget
4. **KIMST** (해양수산과학기술진흥원) - Maritime tech

**Hybrid Data Collection Strategy:**

**Primary Source: NTIS API**
- **Coverage**: 108,798+ R&D programs (historical + current)
- **Purpose**: Pattern analysis, success rate benchmarking, historical trends
- **Schedule**: Daily at 8:00 AM KST
- **Status**: Phase 1 complete, production key arriving Oct 14, 2025
- **Value**: "귀사와 유사한 조직의 평균 선정률: 38%" (powered by 108K historical programs)

**Secondary Source: Playwright Web Scraping**
- **Coverage**: 200-500 active calls from 4 agencies (realistic current opportunities)
- **Purpose**: Real-time announcement monitoring
- **Schedule**: 
  - Normal: 2x daily (9:00 AM, 3:00 PM KST)
  - Peak (Jan-Mar): 4x daily (9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM KST)
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/minute per agency

**CRITICAL: Honest Claims (No "100K+ programs" marketing)**
- Homepage: "국내 주요 4개 기관 최신 공고 200~500건 (매일 업데이트)"
- Subtext: "Plus: 역대 R&D 과제 108,000+ 건 성공 패턴 분석"
- Why: Honest expectations → higher retention (vs. overpromising → disappointment → churn)

#### 3.4 Email Notifications

**Notification Types:**
- New matching opportunity (within 1 hour of scraping, if score >60)
- Deadline reminder (7 days, 3 days, 1 day before)
- Weekly digest (Mondays 9am, summary of new opportunities)
- Outcome tracking reminder (after application deadline, request result update)

**User Controls:**
- Enable/disable notification types
- Set preferred notification time
- Minimum match score threshold (default: 60/100)
- Notification frequency (real-time, daily, weekly)

#### 3.5 Outcome Tracking System (Proprietary Data Moat)

**Purpose**: Create defensible competitive advantage through win rate intelligence

**Data Collection (Opt-in with PIPA Consent):**

Users voluntarily share:
1. **Application Status**: Applied (Yes/No), Application date
2. **Selection Result**: Won / Lost / Pending / Withdrawn
3. **Financial Data** (optional): Requested amount, Award amount
4. **Feedback**: Application difficulty (1-5), Match quality (1-5)

**Consent Requirements (PIPA Compliance):**
- ✅ Explicit checkbox: "Connect의 매칭 정확도 향상을 위해 과제 신청 결과 데이터를 공유합니다"
- ✅ Clear explanation: "귀사의 구체적인 데이터는 공개되지 않으며, 최소 5건 이상 집계된 통계로만 활용됩니다"
- ✅ Opt-out anytime: Users can revoke consent in settings

**Data Usage (Privacy-Preserving):**
- Aggregate statistics only (minimum 5 data points required)
- Example: "귀사와 유사한 산업(ICT) × TRL(7-8) 조직의 IITP 선정률: 38%"
- Example: "평균 심사 기간: 87일"
- Individual results NEVER disclosed

**Competitive Moat:**
- Competitors lack outcome data (only public announcement data)
- Connect's advantage compounds: More users → More outcome data → Better predictions
- Year 1: Basic win rate stats
- Year 2: ML models for win probability prediction
- Year 3: Recommend specific improvements to increase selection probability

- Score 40-70: Partially ready, ₩3-7M + 2-4 months
- Score 70-100: Ready, ₩2-5M + 1-2 months

#### 3.7 Procurement Readiness Calculator (공공조달 준비도)

**Purpose**: Help companies qualify for procurement-track funding (혁신제품 지정, 우수제품 선정)

**Scoring Model (0-100 points):**

1. **Product Maturity (30 points)**
   - TRL 9: 30 points (fully commercialized)
   - TRL 8: 20 points (system complete, tested)
   - TRL 7: 10 points (prototype demonstrated)
   - TRL <7: 0 points (not ready for procurement)

2. **Certifications (30 points)**
   - KC certification: 15 points
   - ISO 9001: 10 points
   - ISMS-P: 5 points (bonus for SaaS)

3. **Track Record (20 points)**

   - A/S infrastructure: 7 points
   - Technical support team: 6 points

**Gap Analysis Output:**

Example for company with 58/100 score:
```
총점: 58/100 - 부분적으로 준비됨

주요 갭:
1. TRL 상향 필요 (현재 TRL 7 → TRL 8+ 필요)
   - 해결 기간: 6-12개월
   - 예상 비용: ₩50-100M

2. KC 인증 미보유
   - 해결 기간: 3-6개월
   - 예상 비용: ₩5-10M

3. 정부 R&D 실적 부족 (0건 → 1건+ 필요)
   - 해결 기간: 1년
   - 비용: 과제 수행 비용

권장 조치:
1. 먼저 기술 개발 R&D 과제 신청 (TRL 상향)
2. KC 인증 취득 병행
3. 1-2년 후 공공조달 사업 신청
```

**CTA for Services:**
- "TRL 상향 컨설팅 서비스 (₩5-7M)"
- "인증 계획 수립 서비스 (₩3-5M)"

#### 3.8 Partner Discovery & Consortium Builder

- ₩4,900/month for first 30 days (promotional rate)
- After 30 days: Auto-upgrade to Pro (₩49,000/month) with 7-day advance notification
- Generates testimonials + early revenue

**Pricing Rationale:**
- ₩49,000/month = Sustainable (covers infrastructure + support)
- vs. ₩12,900 original: Too low, would require external funding
- vs. ₩25,000 (ChatGPT): Competitive for specialized Korean R&D data
- Break-even: ~50 Pro users (₩2.45M/month covers server + 1 developer)

**Toss Payments Implementation:**
- Billing key method for recurring subscriptions
- Auto-charge monthly on `subscriptions.nextBillingDate`
- Failed payment handling: 3 retries over 7 days → Downgrade to Free
- Tax invoice generation for corporate users (세금계산서)

**CRITICAL: Off-Budget Services Invoicing**

**Legal Requirement (국가연구개발사업 연구개발비 사용 기준):**
- Connect services are **business development costs** (사업개발비)
- **CANNOT** be included in government R&D project budgets (연구개발비)
- Must be invoiced separately from R&D project costs
- Must be paid from company's operating budget (운영비)

**MSA Terms (Service Agreement Clause):**
```
제4조 (서비스 비용 청구)
본 약관 제4조 제2항에 명시된 부가 서비스는 기업의 사업개발 비용으로 청구되며,
정부 R&D 과제 연구개발비 예산에 포함되지 않습니다.

법적 근거:
- 「국가연구개발사업 연구개발비 사용 기준」 (IITP 고시 제2025-02호)
- 연구개발비는 직접비(인건비, 연구재료비, 연구활동비 등)와 간접비로만 구성
- 일반 컨설팅 비용은 연구개발비 사용 기준에 포함되지 않음
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects customers from audit risk (과제비 부적정 집행)
- Prevents Connect legal liability (불법 용역 제공)
- Ensures sustainable business model (customers use company budget, not grant budget)

**Customer Communication:**
- Clearly explain during sales: "이 서비스는 귀사의 운영 예산으로 결제됩니다"
- Invoice separately from any R&D projects
- FAQ: "부가 서비스 비용은 R&D 예산에 넣을 수 있나요? → 아니요"

#### 3.11 Usage Analytics Dashboard

## 4. Technical Architecture (Docker-Native)

### 4.1 Production Server Specifications

**Target Hardware:**
- CPU: Intel i9-12900K (16 cores / 24 threads)
- RAM: 128GB DDR4
- Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD
- Network: KT Broadband (164 Mbps up / 325 Mbps down)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

**Performance Targets:**
- Support 500-1,500 concurrent users
- API response time: < 500ms (P95)
- Match generation: < 3 seconds for top 10 results
- System uptime: > 99.9% during peak season (Jan-March) - **HOT STANDBY REQUIRED**

**Hot Standby (Peak Season Insurance):**
- **Why**: January-March = 80% of annual funding announcements, 27 hours downtime = 50+ users miss deadlines = brand destroyed
- **Setup**: Second i9-12900K server, PostgreSQL streaming replication (<5 min RPO), automated failover (<15 min RTO)
- **Cost**: ₩600K/month × 3 months = ₩1.8M (vs. ₩10-50M potential revenue loss)
- **ROI**: Prevents catastrophic failure during peak season

### 4.2 Database Schema (Enhanced)

**New Tables for Services & Outcomes:**

```sql
-- Grant Outcomes (Proprietary Data Moat)
CREATE TABLE grant_outcomes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  funding_program_id UUID REFERENCES funding_programs(id),
  funding_match_id UUID REFERENCES funding_matches(id),
  
  -- Application tracking

## 8. Risk Management & Mitigation

### 8.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Peak season infrastructure failure** | Medium (30%) | Critical | Hot standby server + 99.9% SLO + chaos day testing |
| **NTIS API changes/deprecation** | Low (10%) | High | Diversify with Playwright scraping + monitor API announcements |
| **Data breach (PIPA violation)** | Low (5%) | Critical | AES-256 encryption + explicit consent + annual security audit |
| **Payment processing failures** | Low (10%) | Medium | Toss Payments with retry logic + webhook monitoring |

**Detailed Mitigation: Hot Standby**
- **Trigger**: Primary server hardware failure during Jan-March
- **Impact**: 27 hours downtime = 50+ users miss deadlines = brand destroyed
- **Mitigation**:
  - Hot standby server operational by Dec 31
  - Automated failover script (<15min RTO)
  - PostgreSQL streaming replication (<5min RPO)
  - PagerDuty 24/7 monitoring + SMS alerts
  - Weekly health checks during Jan-Mar
- **Cost**: ₩600K/month × 3 months = ₩1.8M
- **ROI**: Prevents ₩10-50M revenue loss from churn

### 8.2 Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Low conversion (Free→Pro)** | Medium (40%) | High | Free tier validation (10 matches/month) + outcome tracking + referral program |
| **High churn (poor match quality)** | Medium (30%) | High | Sector gates + TRL filtering + outcome feedback loop |
| **Pricing too low (unsustainable)** | Low (20%) | High | A/B test ₩49K vs ₩69K + services revenue supplements |
| **Research institute GTM failure** | High (60%) | Medium | Flip to companies-first GTM + professors for intros only |
| **Competitor with VC funding** | Medium (40%) | Medium | Services moat + outcome data moat + network effects |

**Detailed Mitigation: Low Free→Pro Conversion**
- **Trigger**: <20% conversion rate after 60 days
- **Impact**: Revenue projections miss by 30-40%
- **Mitigation**:
  - Increase free tier to 10 matches/month (was 3)
  - Show outcome data: "Users like you have 38% win rate"
  - Email nurture: Days 7, 14, 30 with success stories
  - Referral incentive: Get Pro free for 1 month per referral
- **Early warning**: Track conversion funnel weekly
- **Decision point**: If <25% by Week 8 → Increase free tier to 15 matches

**Detailed Mitigation: High Churn**
- **Trigger**: >10% monthly churn in first 3 months
- **Impact**: Negative word-of-mouth kills growth
- **Root cause**: Users apply to mismatched grants → rejected → blame Connect
- **Mitigation**:
  - Sector gates (ISMS-P, KC/EMC) prevent ineligible applications
  - TRL gates block applications >2 levels away
  - Show "Estimated win probability: 35%" (manage expectations)
  - Outcome tracking creates feedback loop
  - Offer application review service (₩2-3M) before they apply
- **Early warning**: NPS survey at 30 days
- **Decision point**: If NPS <30 → Pause growth, fix match quality

### 8.3 Competitive Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **VC-funded competitor launches** | Medium (40%) | High | Speed to market + proprietary outcome data |
| **NTIS builds their own matching** | Low (10%) | Critical | Services layer + user relationships |
| **Existing consultant pivots to platform** | Medium (30%) | Medium | Software + services hybrid (consultants can't scale software) |

**Detailed Mitigation: VC-Funded Competitor**
- **Scenario**: Competitor raises ₩500M-1B, launches at ₩29K/month (loss leader)
- **Their advantages**: More capital, larger team, aggressive marketing
- **Our advantages**:
  - 6-12 month head start (they need time to build)
  - Proprietary outcome data (win rates, cycle times) = moat
  - Services revenue funds operations (don't need VC)
  - Direct relationships with 50-100 beta customers
  - Network effects: More users → more outcome data → better matching
- **Counter-strategy**:
  - Build outcome data moat FAST (Month 1-6)
  - Focus on retention over acquisition (happy users don't switch)
  - Expand to services (competitors can't easily replicate)
  - Corporate partnerships create enterprise moat
- **When to worry**: If competitor announced funding >₩1B → Accelerate services expansion
