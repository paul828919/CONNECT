# CONNECT – Product Requirements Document (PRD) v7.0

**Version:** 7.0
**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Status:** Production Ready - Enhanced Architecture
**Scope:** Innovation Ecosystem Platform for Korea's R&D Lifecycle

---

## Executive Summary

CONNECT is an explainable matching platform that accelerates Korea's innovation ecosystem by connecting Companies, Research Institutes, and Universities through the complete R&D lifecycle: Funding → Collaboration → Tech Transfer. Unlike generic AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude) that cost ₩28,000/month, Connect provides verified, real-time Korean R&D opportunities with warm introductions and compliance automation for ₩9,900/month.

**Key Changes in v7.0:**
- **Comprehensive Agency Coverage**: Expanded from 3 to 19 NTIS commissioning agencies
- **Optimized Data Collection**: Multi-daily scraping schedule for fresher data
- **Production-Grade Architecture**: Single-server deployment optimized for i9-12900K hardware
- **Enhanced Safety Measures**: PgBouncer, split Redis, atomic deployments
- **Development Workflow**: MacBook M4 → Linux server deployment pipeline

# 3. Create deployment package (excluding native modules)
tar -czf connect-deployment.tar.gz \
  .next \
  public \
  package.json \
  package-lock.json \
  prisma \
  server.js \
  ecosystem.config.js \

set -euo pipefail

BASE="/opt/connect"
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
RELEASE_DIR="$BASE/releases/$TIMESTAMP"

# Create release directory
mkdir -p $RELEASE_DIR
cd $RELEASE_DIR

# Extract and prepare
tar -xzf $BASE/connect-deployment.tar.gz
rm $BASE/connect-deployment.tar.gz

# Install production dependencies for x86_64
npm ci --production --no-audit

# Run database migrations via PgBouncer
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://connect@localhost:6432/connect" \
  npx prisma migrate deploy

# Health check new version before switching
echo "🔍 Health checking new deployment..."
PORT=3001 pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --name health-check
sleep 10
curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/health || {
  pm2 delete health-check
  exit 1
}
pm2 delete health-check

# Atomic switch (zero downtime)
echo "🔄 Switching to new version..."
ln -sfn $RELEASE_DIR $BASE/current

# Reload PM2 cluster
pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js

# Cleanup old releases (keep 5 most recent)
