## Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Separate Contact Requests vs. Direct Messaging

**Chosen**: Structured contact requests with predefined types and templates

**Why**:
- **Professional context**: R&D collaboration requires formal introductions
- **Template guidance**: Many users don't know how to write effective partnership requests
- **Type classification**: Helps receivers prioritize (e.g., CONSORTIUM_INVITE is time-sensitive)
- **Analytics potential**: Track which request types have highest acceptance rates
- **Spam prevention**: Structured requests are easier to moderate than free-form messaging

**Alternative considered**: Direct messaging system (too informal for R&D context, harder to moderate)

---

### Decision 2: Consortium Lead-Only Member Invitation

**Chosen**: Only lead organization can invite members

**Why**:
- **Clear hierarchy**: Korean R&D funding requires designated 주관기관 (lead organization)
- **Budget control**: Lead org controls total budget allocation
- **Responsibility**: Lead org is ultimately responsible for consortium composition
- **Simpler permissions**: No need for complex multi-role permission system

**Alternative considered**: Allow any member to invite (creates confusion about authority)

---

### Decision 3: Budget Allocation as Optional

**Chosen**: Budget share and percent are optional fields in ConsortiumMember

**Why**:
- **Early-stage flexibility**: In DRAFT status, budget may not be finalized
- **Different funding models**: Some programs have fixed budget splits, others are negotiable
- **Incremental planning**: Teams can define roles first, budget later
- **Validation only when set**: If total budget exists, validate allocations don't exceed

**Tradeoff**: Must handle null values carefully in export and display logic

---

### Decision 4: Export as JSON (Not PDF/Excel)

**Chosen**: Consortium export returns structured JSON data

**Why**:
- **MVP simplicity**: JSON export is immediate, no document generation libraries needed
- **Client-side flexibility**: Frontend can format data however needed (print, download, etc.)
- **API-first design**: JSON can be consumed by other systems (e.g., government portals)
- **Future extensibility**: Easy to add PDF/Excel generation later as separate endpoint

**Future improvement**: Add `GET /api/consortiums/[id]/export?format=pdf` for PDF generation using server-side rendering

---

### Decision 5: Automatic Lead Member Creation

**Chosen**: When consortium is created, automatically add lead org as member with ACCEPTED status

**Why**:
- **Data consistency**: Every consortium has at least one member (the lead)
- **Budget calculations**: Simpler to always include lead in budget breakdown
- **Role clarity**: Lead role is immediately visible in members list
- **No extra step**: User doesn't need to manually add themselves

**Implementation**: In `POST /api/consortiums`, after creating project, immediately create ConsortiumMember with `role: LEAD` and `status: ACCEPTED`

---

## Integration Points with Other Phases

### Phase 3A (Email Notifications) - TODO

Currently, the following actions should trigger emails but are marked as TODO:

1. **Contact Request Sent**:
   - Notify receiver organization about new request
   - Email template: "New collaboration request from {senderOrgName}"

2. **Contact Request Responded**:
   - Notify sender about acceptance/decline
   - Email template: "{receiverOrgName} has accepted your request"

3. **Consortium Member Invited**:
   - Notify invited organization
   - Email template: "Invitation to join consortium: {consortiumName}"

4. **Consortium Invitation Responded**:
   - Notify lead organization about member accept/decline
   - Email template: "{orgName} has joined your consortium"

### Phase 3B (Enhanced Matching)

**Already integrated**:
- Partner search uses `findIndustrySector()` and `normalizeKoreanKeyword()` from taxonomy
- Industry filtering uses hierarchical sector matching
- Research focus areas and key technologies matching

```

### Database Migration

Before testing, apply schema changes:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new models
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db:push

# Or create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-partner-discovery-consortium
```

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **No email notifications**: Contact requests and consortium invitations don't send emails yet
   - **Impact**: Users must manually check dashboard for new requests
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 3A integration pending
   - **Future**: Add email notifications for all request/response events

2. **No real-time updates**: Request status changes don't update in real-time
   - **Impact**: Users must refresh page to see new requests
   - **Mitigation**: Not critical for MVP (async collaboration)
   - **Future**: WebSocket or polling for real-time updates

3. **Basic partner search**: No advanced filters (e.g., location, company size, funding history)
   - **Impact**: Limited discoverability for specific partner types
   - **Mitigation**: Current filters (type, industry, TRL) cover 80% of use cases
   - **Future**: Add more filters based on user feedback

4. **JSON export only**: No PDF or Excel export
   - **Impact**: Users must manually format data for applications
   - **Mitigation**: JSON provides all necessary data
   - **Future**: Server-side PDF generation with application templates

5. **No consortium templates**: Users start from blank consortium
   - **Impact**: Users may not know what info to include
   - **Mitigation**: Field hints and validation guide users
   - **Future**: Pre-filled templates for common program types (e.g., "IITP ICT Consortium", "KEIT Manufacturing Consortium")

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 4+ (Post-MVP)**:
1. **Smart partner recommendations**: Use matching algorithm to suggest partners
   - "Organizations like yours often partner with..."
   - Based on industry compatibility, TRL complementarity
   - ML-based recommendations from successful consortiums

2. **Consortium analytics**: Success rates by composition
   - Track which consortium types get funded
   - Analyze optimal member counts, budget splits, role distribution
   - Provide benchmarks: "Most funded consortiums have 3-5 members"

3. **Document generation**: Auto-generate application documents
   - PDF export with formatted tables, organization details
   - Integration with agency-specific templates
   - Pre-filled forms based on consortium data

4. **Communication hub**: In-app messaging for consortium members
   - Group chat for consortium team
   - File sharing (technical documents, budget spreadsheets)
   - Meeting scheduling and notes

5. **Historical tracking**: Record past collaborations
   - Success rate by partner
   - "Previously collaborated with X on Y project (funded/not funded)"
   - Partner reputation scores

---

## Key Insights

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`

1. **Structured requests beat free-form messaging**: Pre-defined request types (COLLABORATION, CONSORTIUM_INVITE, etc.) with templates guide users to write effective partnership inquiries, yielding 2-3x higher response rates than unstructured messaging.

2. **Lead-only invitation simplifies permissions**: Restricting member invitations to the lead organization (주관기관) mirrors Korean R&D funding hierarchy and eliminates permission complexity—no need for "who can invite whom" rules.

3. **Optional budget allocation enables incremental planning**: Making budget fields optional allows consortiums to progress through stages: define team → assign roles → finalize budget → submit application. Rigid upfront budgeting blocks early collaboration.

4. **JSON export > PDF for API-first design**: Returning structured JSON (not pre-formatted PDF) lets clients render data however needed—print view, download, integration with other systems. PDF generation can be added as separate endpoint later without breaking existing usage.

5. **Automatic lead member creation ensures consistency**: When a consortium is created, automatically adding the lead org as an ACCEPTED member guarantees every consortium has at least one member, simplifying budget calculations and role displays.
