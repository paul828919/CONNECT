**Business Logic:**
- Prevents free tier abuse
- Encourages Pro plan upgrades
- Usage analytics for business intelligence

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Explainable AI Approach
**Why:** Instead of using ML models, we chose rule-based matching with transparent scoring. This allows users to understand *why* they received a recommendation, building trust and helping them improve their profiles.

**Benefit:** Users can see exactly which criteria they met/missed, making the platform educational rather than just prescriptive.

### 2. Content Hashing for Change Detection
**Why:** SHA-256 hashing of program content (title + description + deadline + budget) enables efficient change detection when scraping updates programs.

**Benefit:** Avoid duplicate entries while tracking meaningful updates without storing entire program versions.

### 3. Korean-First UX
**Why:** All explanations, error messages, and UI text are in Korean. The platform targets Korean R&D ecosystem users who expect native language support.

**Benefit:** Lower barrier to entry, better user comprehension, professional localization.

### 4. Rate Limiting as Business Model Enforcer
**Why:** Free tier limit (3/month) is enforced at the API level using Redis, not just client-side checks.

**Benefit:** Prevents abuse, protects infrastructure, creates upgrade incentive, and provides usage analytics.

### 5. Prisma Schema Field Alignment
**Challenge:** During implementation, discovered mismatch between initial algorithm design and actual Prisma schema fields (e.g., `programId` vs `fundingProgramId`).

**Solution:** Updated algorithm and API to use correct schema fields, ensuring database compatibility.

## 🚀 How to Test (Manual E2E)

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Complete flow:**
   - Sign in with Kakao or Naver OAuth
   - Create organization profile (if redirected)
   - Click "매칭 생성하기" on dashboard
   - View top 3 matches on `/dashboard/matches`
   - Click "공고 확인하기" to see program details

4. **Test rate limiting:**
   - Generate 3 matches as free user
   - Try 4th match → should see rate limit error
   - Error message: "이번 달 무료 매칭 횟수를 모두 사용하셨습니다"

## 🎓 Technical Insights

### 1. **TypeScript Type Safety**
The entire implementation leverages Prisma-generated types, ensuring compile-time safety when working with database models. For example:
```typescript
import { Organization, FundingProgram, ProgramStatus } from '@prisma/client';
```
This prevents runtime errors from typos or schema changes.

### 2. **React Server Components**
API routes use Next.js 14 App Router with server-side session handling:
```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
```
This keeps authentication logic on the server, preventing token exposure to clients.

### 3. **Optimistic UI Updates**
Dashboard shows loading states during match generation, providing immediate feedback before the API completes. This improves perceived performance.

### 4. **JSON Storage for Flexibility**
Match explanations are stored as JSON in the database, allowing rich structured data without schema migrations:
```typescript
explanation: {
  summary: string;
  reasons: string[];
  warnings?: string[];
  recommendations?: string[];
}
```
