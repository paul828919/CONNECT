## Test Case 1: Compatibility Score Display

### Expected Behavior
- Each partner card should display a circular compatibility score badge in the top-right corner
- Score badge should be color-coded:
  - 🟢 **Green**: 80-100 points (excellent match)

- Card borders should match the score color

### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/partners`
2. Observe the partner cards in the grid
3. Verify each card has a circular score badge (top-right)
4. Check that border colors match badge colors

### Visual Reference
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Partner Card            [🟢 85] │  <- Circular badge
│                                   │
│  Company Name                     │
│  Industry: AI/ML                  │

## Test Case 3: Sort by Compatibility

### Expected Behavior
- Sort selector should have 3 options:
  1. "호환성 높은 순" (Compatibility - High to Low) [DEFAULT]
  2. "프로필 점수 순" (Profile Score)
  3. "이름 순" (Name - Alphabetical)
- When sorting by compatibility, highest scores should appear first
- Changing sort order should reset to page 1

### Testing Steps
1. Locate the "정렬 기준" (Sort By) dropdown in the filters section
2. Verify default value is "호환성 높은 순"
3. Observe the current order of partners (note top 3 scores)
4. Change to "이름 순" - verify alphabetical order
5. Change to "프로필 점수 순" - verify different ordering
6. Change back to "호환성 높은 순" - verify descending score order

### Verification
```
Expected Order (Compatibility Sort):
Partner A: 95 points
Partner B: 87 points
Partner C: 82 points
Partner D: 75 points
Partner E: 68 points
```

**Pass Criteria**: ✅
- [ ] Sort dropdown exists and is functional
- [ ] Default sort is "호환성 높은 순"
- [ ] Compatibility sort shows highest scores first
- [ ] Changing sort reloads the partner list
- [ ] Pagination resets to page 1 on sort change

## Test Case 4: Color-Coded Borders

### Expected Behavior
- Partner cards with scores ≥80 should have green borders
- Partner cards with scores 60-79 should have yellow borders
- Partner cards with scores <60 should have gray borders
- Hover state should slightly brighten the border color

### Testing Steps
1. Scan the partner grid
2. Identify cards in each score range
3. Verify border colors match score ranges
4. Hover over each card type - verify border brightens slightly

**Pass Criteria**: ✅
- [ ] Green borders for 80-100 scores

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Authentication Required**: Cannot test without signing in
2. **Real User Data Required**: Needs actual organization profiles for best testing
3. **Consortium Preferences**: Compatibility calculation requires both orgs to have preferences set

### Non-Blocking Issues
- TypeScript errors exist in unrelated files (tests, scripts)
- These don't affect Phase 5 functionality

---
