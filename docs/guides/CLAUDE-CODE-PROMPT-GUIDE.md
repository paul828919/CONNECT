## üéØ Recommendation for TODAY (Oct 10, 2025)

### Use: **COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT** ‚úÖ

**Why?**

1. **First Day of Beta Test Plan**
   - New timeline starting today
   - Important to set the right foundation
   - Claude Code needs full context

2. **Complex Load Testing Task**
   - Day 24-25 involves performance testing
   - Multiple scenarios to execute
   - Optimization may be needed
   - Requires detailed specifications

3. **Documentation Critical**
   - Starting new tracking system
   - Need consistent format
   - Examples help ensure quality

4. **Safety First**
   - Load testing involves AI API costs
   - Performance changes affect production readiness
   - Better to be explicit about constraints

## üìù How to Use the Prompts

### Option 1: Copy from File (Recommended)

```bash
# Open the comprehensive prompt
cat docs/guides/CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPT.md

# Copy the text between the ``` marks
# (Everything after "COPY THIS INTO CLAUDE CODE:")
# Paste into Claude Code chat window
```

### Option 2: Direct File Reference

```bash
# If Claude Code supports file reading
# (Check Claude Code documentation)

claude code "Execute tasks from: docs/guides/CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPT.md"
```

### Option 3: Command Line Execution

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project
cd /Users/paulkim/Downloads/connect
claude code

# Then paste the prompt into the chat interface
```

## ‚úÖ After Execution Checklist

**Review Claude Code's Output**:

1. **Check Files Created**:
   ```bash
   ls -la docs/guides/domain-*.md
   ls -la docs/guides/dns-*.md
   ls -la scripts/load-test-*.ts
   ```

2. **Review Load Test Results**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/plans/progress/load-test-results-day1.md
   ```

3. **Verify Status Updated**:
   ```bash
   git diff IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
   git diff docs/plans/BETA-QUICK-REFERENCE.md
   ```

4. **Check for Errors**:
   - Review any error logs
   - Check if all tests passed
   - Verify success criteria met

**Execute Manual Steps** (Domain/DNS):
1. Follow: `docs/guides/domain-purchase-guide.md`
2. Purchase connect.kr domain
3. Follow: `docs/guides/dns-configuration-guide.md`
4. Configure DNS records
5. Follow: `docs/guides/environment-variables-update.md`
6. Update .env files

## üîÑ For Future Days

### Day 2-3 (Oct 11-12): HTTPS + Security
**Recommendation**: QUICK START
- Similar to Day 1 structure
- Less complex than load testing
- You'll understand the pattern by then

### Day 4-7 (Oct 13-16): Bug Fixes
**Recommendation**: QUICK START
- Straightforward debugging
- Can iterate quickly
- Minimal new context needed

### Week 2 Self-Dogfooding (Oct 17-23)
**Recommendation**: COMPREHENSIVE for Day 1, then QUICK START
- First day sets up the testing framework
- Subsequent days follow the pattern
